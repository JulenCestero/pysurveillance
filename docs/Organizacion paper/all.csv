However, the number of parameters and uncertainty factors that characterize built impacts over their full-lifecycle, preclude a broader LCA adoption. This enable faster progress towards reducing building impacts by combining established environmental impact assessment methods with artificial intelligence approaches, such as machine learning (ML) and neural networks. This article will present previous research on ML for LCA of buildings. To achieve this goal, we perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). SLR was governed by the question “What are scientific research developed for Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry in LCA and ML context?”. This SLR was performed in three databases: Scopus, Engineering Village and Web of Science, using keywords: Life Cycle Assessment, Machine Learning, Learning, Building and Neural Network. From SLR, we identified best practices, acquired and developed by other studies, clarifying how to interpret large data sets monitored through advanced analysis to improve LCA. The results showed: (i) number of articles increase in recent years; (ii) the most searched environmental indicators are energy consumption and Global Warming Potential (GWP); (iii) machine learning is mainly used for prediction impacts and; (iv) the most used ML method is Artificial Neural Networks. Advances in LCA and ML field can contribute to calculation and analysis of buildings environmental indicators, as well as can develop and improve LCA methods. The combination of reliable data and ML will produce an unprecedented change in speed and accuracy of LCA. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Life cycle assessment; Machine learning; Neural networks","Buildings; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Global warming; Machine learning; Neural networks; Architecture , engineering and construction industries; Environmental indicators; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Scientific researches; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Uncertainty factors; Life cycle","Barros, N.N.; University of CampinasBrazil; email: natalianakamura.arq@gmail.com",,"Springer",23662557,,,,"English","Lect.

However, there is still a lack of studies discussing the value of performing secondary studies in an academic context. Goal: The main goal of this study is to provide an overview on the use of secondary studies in an academic context. Method: Two empirical research methods were used. Initially, we conducted a SM to identify the available and relevant studies on the use of secondary studies as a research methodology for conducting SE research projects. Secondly, a survey was performed with 64 SE researchers to identify their perception related to the value of performing secondary studies to support their research projects. Results: Our results show benefits of using secondary studies in the academic context, such as providing an overview of the literature as well as identifying relevant research literature on a research area enabling to find reasons to explain why a research project should be approved for a grant and/or supporting decisions made in a research project. Difficulties faced by SE graduate students with secondary studies are that they tend to be conducted by a team and it demands more effort than a traditional review. Conclusions: Secondary studies are valuable to graduate students. They should consider conducting a secondary study for their research project due to the benefits and contributions provided to develop the overall project. However, the advice of an experienced supervisor is essential to avoid bias. In addition, the acquisition of skills can increase student's motivation to pursue their research projects and prepare them for both academic or industrial careers. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Education; Secondary studies; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping","Mapping; Software engineering; Students; Surveys; Empirical research method; Graduate students; Industrial careers; Research methodologies; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Industrial research","de Souza, É.F.; Department of Computer, Federal University of Technology - Paraná - UTFPR, Cornélio Procópio - ParanáBrazil; email: ericasouza@utfpr.edu.br",,"Elsevier Inc.",01641212,,JSSOD,,"English","J Syst Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088403569

Thus, this paper aims to analyze the role of dissimilar national-cultural behaviors on supply chain visibility (SCV), and to evaluate how companies can adapt to these behavioral characteristics to increase SCV internationally. The methodology of the paper is twofold. First, the paper engages in a systematic literature review (SLR) evaluating behavioral characteristics for SCV enhancement. Because of a multi-interpretable nature of existing literature, the study then follows a qualitative approach, including 49 transcribed semi-structured interviews with supply chain experts from 30 companies in Germany, Japan, and the USA. The findings indicate that SCV-enhancing behaviors differ based on cultural characteristics. However, the single consideration of these characteristics possesses an interpretable nature resulting in a paradoxical situation. By this, the findings indicate that similar cultural dimensional characteristics can be dissimilar based on the influence of other dimensional factors. Overall, this study provides an indication of the importance of national culture for SCV, and the relevance of cultural adaption to enhancing SCV. Through this, it opens the door for further research in this field. The three countries selected can be used as a proxy to measure similar cultures based on Hofstede's cultural dimension model (2001), and thus the contribution strives for analytical generalizability beyond the three countries. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Culture; Germany; Japan; Supply chain visibility; USA","Visibility; Behavioral characteristics; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; National cultures; Qualitative approach; Semi structured interviews; Supply chain complexity; Supply chain visibility; Systematic literature review (SLR); Supply chains","Doetzer, M.; Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg, Feldkirchenstraße 21, Germany; email: mathias.doetzer@uni-bamberg.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",09255273,,IJPCE,,"English","Int J Prod Econ",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086468061

Many of these SLRs are now potentially not fully up-to-date, and there are no standard proposals on how to update SLRs in SE. Objective: The objective of this paper is to propose guidelines on how to best search for evidence when updating SLRs in SE, and to evaluate these guidelines using an SLR that was not employed during the formulation of the guidelines. Method: To propose our guidelines, we compare and discuss outcomes from applying different search strategies to identify primary studies in a published SLR, an SLR update, and two replications in the area of effort estimation. These guidelines are then evaluated using an SLR in the area of software ecosystems, its update and a replication. Results: The use of a single iteration forward snowballing with Google Scholar, and employing as a seed set the original SLR and its primary studies is the most cost-effective way to search for new evidence when updating SLRs. Furthermore, the importance of having more than one researcher involved in the selection of papers when applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria is highlighted through the results. Conclusions: Our proposed guidelines formulated based upon an effort estimation SLR, its update and two replications, were supported when using an SLR in the area of software ecosystems, its update and a replication. Therefore, we put forward that our guidelines ought to be adopted for updating SLRs in SE. © 2020","Searching for evidence; Snowballing; Software engineering; Systematic literature review update; Systematic literature reviews","Cost effectiveness; Ecosystems; Iterative methods; Cost effective; Effort Estimation; Google scholar; Inclusion and exclusions; Search strategies; Seed set; Software ecosystems; Systematic literature review; Software engineering","Wohlin, C.; Department of Software Engineering, Blekinge Institute of TechnologySweden; email: claes.wohlin@bth.se",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086562618

There are no well-established development guidelines, but the literature contains reports on how companies develop and maintain deployed ML-based software systems. Objective: This study aims to survey the literature related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based systems in industrial settings in order to provide a synthesis of the challenges that practitioners face. In addition, we identify solutions used to address some of these challenges. Method: A systematic literature review was conducted and we identified 72 papers related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings. The selected articles were qualitatively analyzed by extracting challenges and solutions. The challenges and solutions were thematically synthesized into four quality attributes: adaptability, scalability, safety and privacy. The analysis was done in relation to ML workflow, i.e. data acquisition, training, evaluation, and deployment. Results: We identified a total of 23 challenges and 8 solutions related to development and maintenance of large scale ML-based software systems in industrial settings including six different domains. Challenges were most often reported in relation to adaptability and scalability. Safety and privacy challenges had the least reported solutions. Conclusion: The development and maintenance on large-scale ML-based systems in industrial settings introduce new challenges specific for ML, and for the known challenges characteristic for these types of systems, require new methods in overcoming the challenges. The identified challenges highlight important concerns in ML system development practice and the lack of solutions point to directions for future research. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Challenges; Industrial settings; Machine learning systems; SLR; Software engineering; Solutions","Computer software; Data acquisition; Machine learning; Scalability; Different domains; Industrial settings; Large-scale machine learning; Ml systems; Quality attributes; Real-world; Software systems; Systematic literature review; Computer software maintenance","Lwakatare, L.E.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers University of Technology, Hörselgången 11, Sweden; email: llucy@chalmers.se",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087690796

A common kind of bias arises when selecting studies using a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria. This bias can be decreased through dual revision, which makes the selection process more time-consuming and remains prone to generating bias depending on how each researcher interprets the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Objective: To reduce the bias and time spent in the study selection process, this paper presents a process for selecting studies based on the use of Cohen's Kappa statistic. We have defined an iterative process based on the use of this statistic during which the criteria are refined until obtain almost perfect agreement (k>0.8). At this point, the two researchers interpret the selection criteria in the same way, and thus, the bias is reduced. Starting from this agreement, dual review can be eliminated; consequently, the time spent is drastically shortened. Method: The feasibility of this iterative process for selecting studies is demonstrated through a tertiary study in the area of software engineering on works that were published from 2005 to 2018. Results: The time saved in the study selection process was 28% (for 152 studies) and if the number of studies is sufficiently large, the time saved tend asymptotically to 50%. Conclusions: Researchers and students may take advantage of this iterative process for selecting studies when conducting SLRs to reduce bias in the interpretation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. It is especially useful for research with few resources. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Cohen's kappa; Evidence-based practice; Systematic review","Software engineering; Cohen's kappas; Inclusion and exclusions; Iterative process; Selection criteria; Systematic literature review; Tertiary study; Time spent; Iterative methods","Díaz, J.; Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (Technical University of Madrid)Spain; email: yesica.diaz@upm.es",,"Elsevier Inc.",01641212,,JSSOD,,"English","J Syst Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085270179

Many of these SLRs are now potentially outdated, and there are no systematic proposals on when to update SLRs in SE. [Objective] The goal of this paper is to provide recommendations on when to update SLRs in SE. [Method] We evaluated, using a three-step approach, a third-party decision framework (3PDF) employed in other fields, to decide whether SLRs need updating. First, we conducted a literature review of SLR updates in SE and contacted the authors to obtain their feedback relating to the usefulness of the 3PDF within the context of SLR updates in SE. Second, we used these authors’ feedback to see whether the framework needed any adaptation; none was suggested. Third, we applied the 3PDF to the SLR updates identified in our literature review. [Results] The 3PDF showed that 14 of the 20 SLRs did not need updating. This supports the use of a decision support mechanism (such as the 3PDF) to help the SE community decide when to update SLRs. [Conclusions] We put forward that the 3PDF should be adopted by the SE community to keep relevant evidence up to date and to avoid wasting effort with unnecessary updates. © 2020","Software engineering; Systematic literature review update; Systematic literature reviews","Decision support systems; Decision framework; Decision supports; Literature reviews; Systematic literature review; Third parties; Three-step approach; Software engineering","Mendes, E.; Department of Computer Science, Blekinge Institute of TechnologySweden; email: emilia.mendes@bth.se",,"Elsevier Inc.",01641212,,JSSOD,,"English","J Syst Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084732557

It also roots out some of the major limitations of the cloud scenario where there exists the need for extremely low latency. Despite its compelling advantages, fog computing is still an evolving paradigm that demands further research. Among all the other issues prevalent in fog computing, security is one of the burning issues. Fog nodes, being at the edge of the network, pose several security threats. The authors have thus conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on security issues in fog computing scenario. Initially, the prevalent security issues are identified through an in-depth survey and then the available literature per security issue is analyzed systematically. This SLR reveals that the security in/through fog scenario is being addressed by the researchers all over the globe. But, the approaches with respect to fog environment still lack methods to evaluate security aspects. Though most of the researchers are prioritizing the consideration of security aspects at fog level, there still exists a need to consider fog computing security as an area of serious concern. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Big data; Fog computing; Internet of Things; Security","Fog; Cloud services; Computing security; Depth surveys; Security aspects; Security issues; Security threats; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Fog computing","Kaur, J.; Department of Information Technology, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University (A Central University)India; email: jasleenkaur.lmp@gmail.com",,"Springer",10689605,,IJWNE,,"English","Int J Wireless Inf Networks",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086029743

In fact, there are several examples wherein the occurrence of certain events resulted in considerable costs. Thus, it is important to ensure that SCs can apply preemptive measures, rather than just react to disruptions that may occur. Simulation tools may play an important role in achieving this, as these tools may be used to test alternative scenarios, as well as to quantify the impact of risks. To fully exploit this possibility, simulation tools should be used as data integration tools, so that the aforementioned analysis can be conducted using data from several relevant sources, thereby improving the quality of such analysis. In this regard, this paper proposes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of simulation methods that deal with risks in SCs, with particular emphasis on the type of data integration employed by such works. The obtained results show that researchers tend to simplify the problem at hand, without modeling their entire complexity, and failing to properly integrate data from the involved processes. The analyzed works’ compliance with Industry 4.0 (I4.0) revealed similar conclusions, as it was found that studies tend to disregard some of the main features of simulation in I4.0. In light of the obtained findings, literature gaps are identified, and future research directions are proposed. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Big data; Data integration; Industry 4.0; Simulation; Supply chain risk management; Systematic Literature Review","Quality control; Risk perception; Supply chains; Dynamic network; Future research directions; Integration tools; Literature reviews; Systematic literature review (SLR); Data integration","Vieira, A.A.C.; ALGORITMI Research Centre, University of MinhoPortugal; email: antonio.vieira@dps.uminho.pt",,"Elsevier B.V.",2452414X,,,,"English","J.

Managing these “things” is still considered a challenge. One way to overcome this challenge may be by adopting the software product line (SPL) paradigm and the variability management (VM) activity. SPL engineering consists of mechanisms that provide identification, representation, and traceability, which may be helpful to “things” management supported by VM organizational and technical activities. Objective: This research aims to investigate how SPL engineering has been applied along with the IoT paradigm, as well as how VM is being carried out. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted considering papers available until March 2019. This systematic review identified 1039 papers. After eliminating the duplicated titles and the ones not related to the review, 112 papers remained. The number of papers was narrowed to 56 after applying the exclusion criteria. Results: The results provide evidence on the diversity of proposed SPLs used to specify approaches for managing IoT systems. However, most SPLs and research developed for IoT lack a systematic and detailed specification to ensure their quality, as well as tailoring guidelines for further use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Families of systems; Internet of things; Product family engineering; Software product line; Variability management","Computer software; Paper; Internet of Things (IOT); Software Product Line; Software product lines; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Technical activities; Variability management; Internet of things","Malucelli, A.; Graduate Program in Computer Science (PPGIa), Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná (PUCPR)Brazil; email: malu@ppgia.pucpr.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083274270

The expected clinical benefit and cost effectiveness of these treatments in clinical practice have yet to be fully confirmed. Health medico-administrative databases may be useful for assessing the value of anticancer drugs with real-world data. Objective: The objectives of our systematic literature review (SLR) were to analyse economic evaluations of anticancer drugs based on health medico-administrative databases, to assess the quality of these evaluations, and to identify the inputs from such databases that can be used in economic evaluations of anticancer drugs. Methods: We performed an SLR by using PubMed and Web of Science articles published from January 2008 to January 2019. The search strategy focused on anticancer drug cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs)/cost-utility analyses (CUAs) that were entirely based on medico-administrative databases. The review reported the main choices of economic evaluation methods in the analyses. The quality of the articles was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) and risk of bias assessment checklists. Results: Of the 306 records identified in PubMed, 12 articles were selected, and one additional article was identified through Web of Science. Ten of the 13 articles were CEAs and three were CUAs. Most of the analyses were carried out in North America (n = 11). The economic metric used was the cost per life-year gained (n = 10) or cost per quality-adjusted life-year (n = 3). Reporting of the target analysis population and strategies in the articles was in agreement with the CHEERS guidelines. The structural assumptions underpinning the economic models displayed the poorest reporting quality among the items analysed. Representativeness bias (n = 11) and the issue of censored medical costs (n = 8) were the most frequently analysed risks. Conclusion: A comparison of the economic results was not relevant due to the high heterogeneity of the selected studies. Our SLR highlighted the benefits and pitfalls related to the use of medico-administrative databases in the economic evaluations of anticancer drugs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"antineoplastic agent; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; economic evaluation; economic model; health insurance; human; quality adjusted life year; quality control; reimbursement; Review; systematic review","Ghabri, S.; Department of Economic and Public Health Evaluation, French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorité de Santé, HAS), 5 Avenue du Stade de France, France; email: s.ghabri@has-sante.fr",,"Adis",11755652,,AHEHA,"32056121","English","Appl.

Granulomatous reactions have been reported related to these drugs. We performed a systematic review of all the cases described in the medical literature by the search ((“Melanoma”[Mesh]) AND (“Sarcoidosis”[Mesh] OR “Granuloma”[Mesh])). Ninety-one patients under immunotherapy were included in the analyses. The time from the initiation of the immunotherapy until the onset of sarcoidosis or sarcoid-like reaction (SLR) was 7.1 months (SD 9). Peripheral lymph nodes as the mode of onset were seen more frequently in patients under CTLA-4 inhibitors (p = .016) whereas in patients under BRAF/MEK inhibitors used to be in the form of specific skin lesions (p = .006). Chest X-ray stage I-II was the rule in the CTLA-4 and PD-1 groups. On the contrary, stage 0 accounted for 80% of the patients in the BRAF/MEK group examined for pulmonary involvement. Specific skin involvement was the most common manifestation apart from pulmonary involvement. It was more frequent in patients under BRAF/MEK inhibitors and especially in the form of papules. Splenic involvement was found also more frequently in patients under CTLA-4 inhibitors. Specific treatment for sarcoidosis/SLR was prescribed in 50 patients (58.8%), without differences among groups. Almost all patients presented a good prognosis independently of the decision made regarding their previous immunotherapy. Conclusion: Physicians should bear in mind the possibility of sarcoidosis/SLR after the initiation of checkpoint or BRAF/MEK inhibitors in patients diagnosed with advanced melanoma, especially in the form of skin involvement and mediastinal and peripheral lymph nodes. It is important to achieve an accurate diagnosis to rule out the possibility of cancer involvement. What to do with these drugs is yet to be clarified. It seems reasonable to prioritize cancer treatment so it is not mandatory to stop these drugs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","BRAF/MEK inhibitors; Checkpoint inhibitors; Immunotherapy; Melanoma; Sarcoidosis",,"Rubio-Rivas, M.; Bellvitge University Hospital, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain; email: mrubio@bellvitgehospital.cat",,"Elsevier B.V.",15689972,,ARUEB,"32553612","English","Autoimmun.

Presence of positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is regarded as a typical feature of autoimmunity. Many studies had tried to clarify the association of ANA with RPL, but the conclusions were controversial. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess whether ANA was positively associated with increased RPL risk. Methods: We searched PubMed and Embase databases for relevant literatures on the association between ANA positivity and RPL. The odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were pooled using meta-analysis, and either fixed-effect or random-effect model was used based on heterogeneity across the included studies. Results: Twenty-one studies with 5038 participants (including 2683 RPL patients and 2355 controls) met the inclusion criteria were included. The total positive rate of ANA was 22.0% (591/2683) in RPL group, and 8.3% (196/2355) in the control group. RPL patients had a significantly higher ANA positive rate than controls (OR = 2.97, 95%CI 1.91-4.64, P<0.00001; I² = 75%), and a significant association between positive ANA and unexplained RPL was also observed (OR = 3.27, 95%CI 2.01-5.31, P<0.00001; I² = 70%). ANA positivity was also significantly associated with increased risk of RPL in women without defined autoimmune diseases (OR = 2.23, 95%CI 1.40-3.55, P=0.0007). Subgroup analysis demonstrated low titers of ANA (1:40≤ANA≤1: 80) were not associated with RPL (OR = 2.44, 95%CI 0.42-14.06, P=0.32), while higher ANA titer (≥1:160) had a significant association with RPL (OR = 45.89, 95%CI 8.44-249.45, P<0.00001). A higher rate of homogenous pattern in RPL patients was observed (OR = 4.89, 95%CI 2.20-10.87, P<0.001), and no significant difference in speckled pattern or nucleolar pattern was found. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that ANA positivity was positively associated with increased RPL risk. ANA positivity is an important risk factor for RPL which needed to be screened among women with RPL. © 2020 The Author(s)","Antinuclear antibody; Meta-analysis; Recurrent pregnancy loss; Risk factor","antinuclear antibody; centromere antibody; double stranded DNA antibody; histone antibody; La antibody; mitochondrion antibody; neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; phospholipid antibody; Ro antibody; single stranded DNA; Sm antibody; antibody blood level; antibody detection; antibody screening; antibody titer; disease association; disease course; human; meta analysis; pregnancy disorder; priority journal; protein function; recurrent pregnancy loss; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review",,,"W.B.

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to investigate the effect of companion animals (whether simply as pets or used in more formal intervention approaches) on the physical and mental health of older adults (aged 60+). Methods:. The reviewers identified key search terms and conducted a systematic search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases. The 70 articles reviewed were evaluated through tabular and thematic analysis. Results:. In 52 of the studies examined, companion animals positively contributed to the mental and/or physical health of older adults. With respect to mental health, involvement with a companion animal improved participant quality of life and effectively attenuated symptoms of depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In relation to physical health, marked increases in physical activity and improvements in blood pressure and heart rate variability were the only consistent physical health improvements observed from companion animal interactions. Conclusions:. Animal companionship can benefit the mental and physical health of older adults, although more and better controlled research on this topic is required. Clinical Implications:. Use of companion animals has the potential to be an effective treatment or adjunct therapy to improve the health status and quality of life of older individuals. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","aging; animal assisted activity; Animal assisted therapy; animal companionship; health; mental health; older adult; pet ownership",,"Pachana, N.A.; School of Psychology, The University of QueenslandAustralia; email: npachana@psy.uq.edu.au",,"Routledge",07317115,,CLGED,"31423915","English","Clin.

In this paper, we report on a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement on methods or approaches reported for supporting material selection processes. This review covers various published literature, spanning from 2000 to 2018. The purpose is to examine in detail the evolution of the extensive body of research, its research streams and to position possible areas for further research. A classification framework consisting of six categories of selection approaches was derived from the extensive literature. Additionally, a detailed analysis of predominant approaches was presented along with their advantages and limitations with respect to the material selection domain. Taken together, the insights gained from this study may be of assistance to new researchers and practitioners who are looking for potential selection methods for their specific applications. The review also found that there is an increasing trend of research in recent years in the area of OR-based method application specifically on the multi-criteria decision-making supporting material selection processes. © IMechE 2020.","Material selection; MCDM; systematic review","Materials; Classification framework; Industrial designers; Material selection; Multi criteria decision making; Potential selection; Supporting material; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technological advancement; Decision making","Musa, S.N.; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of MalayaMalaysia; email: nurmaya@um.edu.my",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",14644207,,,,"English","Proc.

Therefore, it would be valuable to have a conceptualized software testing ontology that explicitly and unambiguously defines the concepts. Consequently, it is important to find out the available evidence in the literature on primary studies for software testing ontologies. In particular, we are looking for research that has a rich ontological coverage that includes Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) and Functional Requirements (FRs) concepts in conjunction with static and dynamic testing concepts, which can be used in method and process specifications for a family of testing strategies. Objective: The main goal for this secondary study is to identify, evaluate and synthesize the available primary studies on conceptualized software testing ontologies. Method: To conduct this study, we use the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach, which follows our enhanced SLR process. We set three research questions. Additionally, to quantitatively evaluate the quality of the selected conceptualized ontologies, we designed a NFRs tree and its associated metrics and indicators. Results: We obtained 12 primary studies documenting conceptualized testing ontologies by using three different retrieval methods. In general, we noted that most of them have a lack of NFRs and static testing terminological coverage. Finally, we observe that none of them is directly linked with FRs and NFRs conceptual components. Conclusion: A general benefit of having the suitable software testing ontology is to minimize the current heterogeneity, ambiguity and incompleteness problems in terms, properties and relationships. We have confirmed that exists heterogeneity, ambiguity, and incompleteness for concepts dealing with testing artifacts, roles, activities, and methods. Moreover, we did not find the suitable ontology for our aim since none of the conceptualized ontologies are directly linked with NFRs and FRs components. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Analysis; Secondary study; Software testing ontology; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review process; Testing strategy","Dynamic analysis; Ontology; Quality control; Functional requirement; Non-functional requirements; Process specification; Research questions; Retrieval methods; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Testing strategies; Software testing","Tebes, G.; GIDIS_Web, Engineering School, UNLPam, Argentina; email: guido.tebes92@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083292574

Resistance can lead to unwillingness on the part of the investors to invest in a particular financial product. On the other hand, inertia can potentially lead to loyalty, despite dissatisfaction with a financial product. Consequently, an understanding of the antecedents and outcomes of retail investors’ resistance and inertia toward investments is valuable for firms selling investment products. Although the literature on resistance and inertia is around three decades old, empirical research related to retail investment decision making has only recently gained momentum, resulting in limited but interesting findings. The current study utilizes a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to review prior studies in this domain. The SLR presents research profiling and an extensive content analysis of the studies selected by applying a robust search protocol. The study findings highlight numerous aspects of retail investment behavior, underscore research gaps in the prior literature, and offer recommendations for future research. Furthermore, a comprehensive framework, labelled resistance adoption inertia continuance (RAIC), is proposed to investigate the behavior of retail investors. The study concludes with meaningful theoretical and practical implications that can help counter resistance and inertia toward different financial products. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Behavioral finance; Consumer behavior; Inertia; Resistance; Retail investor; Systematic literature review (SLR)","consumption behavior; investment; literature review; retailing","Dhir, A.; School of Business and Management, Lappeenranta University of TechnologyFinland; email: amandeep.dhir@lut.fi",,"Elsevier Ltd",09696989,,,,"English","J.

Using digital library (or database) searches or snowballing alone may not be enough to achieve high-quality results. On the other hand, using both digital library searches and snowballing together may increase the overall review effort. Objective: The goal of this research is to propose and evaluate hybrid search strategies that selectively combine database searches with snowballing. Method: We propose four hybrid search strategies combining database searches in digital libraries with iterative, parallel, or sequential backward and forward snowballing. We simulated the strategies over three existing SLRs in SE that adopted both database searches and snowballing. We compared the outcome of digital library searches, snowballing, and hybrid strategies using precision, recall, and F-measure to investigate the performance of each strategy. Results: Our results show that, for the analyzed SLRs, combining database searches from the Scopus digital library with parallel or sequential snowballing achieved the most appropriate balance of precision and recall. Conclusion: We put forward that, depending on the goals of the SLR and the available resources, using a hybrid search strategy involving a representative digital library and parallel or sequential snowballing tends to represent an appropriate alternative to be used when searching for evidence in SLRs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Database Search; Search Strategy; Snowballing; Software Engineering; Systematic literature review","Database systems; Information retrieval; Iterative methods; Search engines; Software engineering; Software quality; Database searches; Hybrid search strategies; Hybrid strategies; Precision and recall; Search strategies; Snowballing; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Digital libraries","Kalinowski, M.; Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio)Brazil; email: kalinowski@inf.puc-rio.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082688364

Today, however, there is a growing amount of studies that have provided methods to objectively monitor social behavior through ubiquitous devices and have used this information to support mental health services. In this paper, we present a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify, analyze and characterize the state of the art about the use of ubiquitous devices to monitor users’ social behavior focused on mental health. For this purpose, we performed an exhaustive literature search on the six main digital libraries. A screening process was conducted on 160 peer-reviewed publications by applying suitable selection criteria to define the appropriate studies to the scope of this SLR. Next, 20 selected studies were forwarded to the data extraction phase. From an analysis of the selected studies, we recognized the types of social situations identified, the process of transforming contextual data into social situations, the use of social situation awareness to support mental health monitoring, and the methods used to evaluate proposed solutions. Additionally, we identified the main trends presented by this research area, as well as open questions and perspectives for future research. Results of this SLR showed that social situation-aware ubiquitous systems represent promising assistance tools for patients and mental health professionals.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is the established methodology for the quantification of environmental impacts, and therefore has been increasingly applied to assess the environmental performance of buildings. By coupling LCAs with digital design tools, e.g., building information modeling (BIM), the identification of environmental hotspots and their mitigation is possible during the design process. The objective of the study is to identify the current integration approaches, and determine the pros and cons of the integration process from different viewpoints, namely, technical, informational, organizational and functional issues. Therefore, a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) was performed. We identified 60 relevant BIM-LCA case studies and analyzed the applied BIM-LCA workflows in detail. A total of 16 of the reviewed studies applied LCA during the early design stage. These studies used a manual or semiautomatic data exchange between the BIM models and LCA tools. In most cases, contemporary BIM-LCA workflows utilized conventional spreadsheets (e.g., Excel sheets in 16 cases). However, the analysis shows that an automated link between LCA and BIM can be achieved when overcoming the technical, organizational and informational issues discussed in the paper. This could enable the streamlining of LCA applications in design practice, and thus support the necessary improvements in the environmental performance of buildings. © 2020 by the authors.","Bill of quantities (BoQ); Building information modeling (BIM); Environmental product declarations (EPD); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Systematic literature review (SLR); Workflow",,"Passer, A.; Working Group Sustainable Construction, Graz University of Technology, Waagner-Biro-Straße 100, Austria; email: alexander.passer@tugraz.at",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088638538

However, despite the achievements made in the field of VR, it is still an emerging technology that lacks deeper exploration and development in industrial application scenarios, especially in the coming fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). This paper aims to systematically investigate the applications of VR in industrial maintenance to discover evidence of its values, limitations, and future directions so that VR can be guided to better serve manufacturing enterprises in remaining competitive in the coming Industry 4.0. A systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is adopted to review primary studies on this topic, by which 86 studies are ultimately included. The results show that VR has proved its value in benefiting maintenance issues through the product lifecycle. However, VR is still not an indispensable element for the lifecycle management of products regarding maintenance-related issues.

However, there is no consensus on optimal IAP levels to improve surgical outcomes. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to examine outcomes of low, standard, and high IAP among adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: An electronic database search was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared outcomes of low, standard, and high IAP among adults undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was used to conduct pairwise meta-analyses and indirect treatment comparisons of the levels of IAP assessed across trials. Results: The SLR and NMA included 22 studies. Compared with standard IAP, on a scale of 0 (no pain at all) to 10 (worst imaginable pain), low IAP was associated with significantly lower overall pain scores at 24 h (mean difference [MD]: − 0.70; 95% credible interval [CrI]: − 1.26, − 0.13) and reduced risk of shoulder pain 24 h (odds ratio [OR] 0.24; 95% CrI 0.12, 0.48) and 72 h post-surgery (OR 0.22; 95% CrI 0.07, 0.65). Hospital stay was shorter with low IAP (MD: − 0.14 days; 95% CrI − 0.30, − 0.01). High IAP was not associated with a significant difference for these outcomes when compared with standard or low IAP. No significant differences were found between the IAP levels regarding need for conversion to open surgery; post-operative acute bleeding, pain at 72 h, nausea, and vomiting; and duration of surgery. Conclusions: Our study of published trials indicates that using low, as opposed to standard, IAP during laparoscopic cholecystectomy may reduce patients’ post-operative pain, including shoulder pain, and length of hospital stay. Heterogeneity in the pooled estimates and high risk of bias of the included trials suggest the need for high-quality, adequately powered RCTs to confirm these findings. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cholecystectomy; Laparoscopy; Neuromuscular blockade; Pneumoperitoneum; Post-operative intra-abdominal pressure","abdominal pressure; clinical outcome; conversion to open surgery; health care utilization; hospitalization; human; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; length of stay; meta analysis; neuromuscular blocking; patient-reported outcome; perioperative period; pneumoperitoneum; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative nausea and vomiting; postoperative pain; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk reduction; shoulder pain; systematic review","Fuchs-Buder, T.; Department of Anesthesiology & Critical Care, Brabois University Hospital, University de Lorraine, CHRU Nancy, 7 allée du Morvan, France; email: t.fuchs-buder@chru-nancy.fr",,"Springer",09302794,,,"32253560","English","Surg.

CL/P is caused by genetic and environmental factors (maternal smoking, alcohol or drug use and others). Many genes and loci were associated with cleft lip/palate but the amount of heterogeneity justifies identifying new causal genes and variants. AHRR (Aryl-Hydrocarbon Receptor Repressor) gene has recently been related to CL/P however, few functional studies analyze the genotypephenotype interaction of AHRR with CL/P. Several studies associate the molecular pathway of AHRR to CL/P which indicates this gene as a functional candidate in CL/P etiology. Methods: Systematic Literature Review was performed using PUBMED database with the keywords cleft lip, cleft palate, orofacial cleft, AHRR and synonyms. SLR resulted in 37 included articles. Results: AHRR is a positional and functional candidate gene for CL/P. In silico analysis detected interactions with other genes previously associated to CL/P like ARNT and CYP1A1. AHRR protein regulates cellular toxicity through TCDD mediated AHR pathway. Exposure to TCDD in animal embryos is AHR mediated and lead to cleft palate due to palate fusion failure and post fusion rupture. AHRR regulates cellular growth and differentiation, fundamental to lip and palatogenesis. AHRR decreases carcinogenesis and recently a higher tumor risk has been described in CL/P patients and families. AHRR is also a smoking biomarker due to changed methylation sites found in smokers DNA although folate intake may partially revert these methylation alterations. This corroborates the role of maternal smoking and lack of folate supplementation as risk factors for CL/P. Conclusion: This research identified the importance of AHRR in dioxin response and demonstrated an example of genetic and environmental interaction, indispensable in the development of many complex diseases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AHRR gene; Cleft lip and palate; Cleft palate; Craniofacial anomalies; Genetics; Genotype-phenotype correlation","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1B1; folic acid; cell differentiation; cell growth; cleft lip with or without cleft palate; DNA methylation; extracellular matrix; folate intake; gene expression level; gene fusion; gene locus; gene structure; genetic variability; genotype phenotype correlation; human; maternal smoking; Medline; priority journal; protein domain; protein protein interaction; protein structure; risk factor; RNA sequencing; Short Survey; smoking; systematic review","Herai, R.H.; Graduate Program in Health Sciences (PPGCS), School of Medicine, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná (PUCPR), R.

Most of the project managers were only aware about the software risks when the software risk has occurred during the project. Therefore, an overview to visualize and prioritize software risks using sensitivity analysis need to be developed to help project managers determine software risks that has occurred in software engineering projects. This study adopts Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the methodology to identify the software risks that have occurred in the project and a web-based integrated with risk sensitivity analysis approach to visualize and prioritize the software risks.

To the best of the author’s knowledge, an SLR rooted in bibliometric analysis has not been carried focusing on advent developments in CLSC. SLR employs scientific methodologies to select papers from standard databases. The SLR using advanced bibliometric and network analysis enables unveiling the key features of the contemporary literature. Design/methodology/approach: The author has analyzed over 333 documents published from 2008 and onward. Using the contemporary tools from bibliometric analysis tools, the author presented an exploratory analysis. A network analysis is utilized to visualize literature and create clusters for the cocited research studies, keywords and publication sources. A detailed multivariate analysis of most influential works published based top 100 articles via a cocitation matrix is done. The multivariate analysis used k-means clustering in which optimal number of clusters are estimated. The analysis is further extended by using a factor analysis, which enables determining the most influential clusters in the k-means clustering analysis. Findings: The SLR using a bibliometric and network analysis enables unveiling the key features of the contemporary literature in CLSC. The author examined published research for influential authors, sources, region, among other key aspects. Network analysis enabled visualizing the clusters of cocited research studies, cowords and publication sources. Cluster analysis of cocited research studies is further explored using k-means clustering. Factor analysis extends findings by identifying most contributing grouping of research areas within CLSC research. Each clustering technique disclosed a unique grouping structure. Originality/value: CLSC has received considerable attention, and its core areas start with focusing on reverse logistics concepts relating reuse, recycling, remanufacturing, among others. Contemporarily, the studies have enhanced reverse logistics core functionalities interfaced with the other interesting avenues related to CO2 emission reduction, greening and environmental protection, sustainability, product design and governmental policies. Earlier studies have presented a literature review of CLSC; however, these reviews are commonly conducted in the traditional manner where the authors select papers based on their area of expertise, interest and experience. As such these reviews fall short in utilizing the advanced tools from bibliometric analysis. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric analysis (BA); Closed-loop supply chain (CLSC); Clustering; Factor analysis; Network analysis; Reverse logistics (RL); Systematic literature review (SLR)",,"Raza, S.A.; Department of Operations Management and Business Statistics, Sultan Qaboos UniversityOman; email: syed@squ.edu.om",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14635771,,BQMTF,,"English","Benchmarking",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086004506

Mobile electronic devices are widely used across socioeconomic categories and may provide a means of extending the reach and efficiency of health care interventions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding mobile health (mHealth) for the treatment of childhood overweight and obesity to map the breadth and nature of the literature in this field and describe the characteristics of published studies. METHODS: We conducted a systematic scoping review in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews, by searching nine academic databases in addition to gray literature for studies describing acceptability, usability, feasibility, effectiveness, adherence, or cost-effectiveness of interventions assessing mHealth for childhood obesity treatment. We also hand searched the reference lists of relevant articles. Studies aimed at the prevention of overweight or obesity were excluded, as were studies in which mHealth was not the primary mode of treatment delivery for at least one study arm or was not independently assessed. A random portion of all abstracts and full texts was double screened by a second reviewer to ensure consistency. Data were charted according to study characteristics, including design, participants, intervention content, behavior change theory (BCT) underpinning the study, mode of delivery, and outcomes measured. RESULTS: We identified 42 eligible studies assessing acceptability (n=7), usability (n=2), feasibility or pilot studies (n=15), treatment effect (n=17), and fidelity (n=1). Change in BMI z-scores or percentiles was most commonly measured, among a variety of dietary, physical activity, psychological, and usability or acceptability measures. SMS, mobile apps, and wearable devices made up the majority of mobile interventions, and 69% (29/42) of the studies specified a BCT used. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric weight management using mHealth is an emerging field, with most work to date aimed at developing and piloting such interventions. Few large trials are published, and these are heterogeneous in nature and rarely reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials for eHealth guidelines. There is an evidence gap in the cost-effectiveness analyses of such studies. ©Louise Tully, Amanda Burls, Jan Sorensen, Riyad El-Moslemany, Grace O'Malley.

However, existing studies do not provide a systematic approach for this managerial process. Within the business domain, competitive intelligence (CI) is a proven systematic process, which is applied to enhance organizations’ competitiveness through the systematic collection, conversion and countering of information. Therefore, the objective of this comparative systematic literature review (SLR) was to establish similarities between the business CI elements and sport performance analysis (PA). The review was conducted from the functionalist quadrant, to provide rational explanations where mechanical analogies from the business CI domain were used for modelling and understanding the particular phenomenon of the CI process in sport. A systematic review protocol was established, and a total of 61 articles from the CI (34) and PA (27) domains were included. The SLR revealed substantial similarities of the current sport PA elements to the business CI process. The similarities were used to develop an information management process, which is illustrated as a literature CI model for sport coaches. Specific differences between the two domains indicated that empirical research is needed to fill the gaps of sport CI elements description. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Competitive intelligence; Development; Process; Sport","Competition; Competitive intelligence; Decision making; Processing; Development; Empirical research; Environmental information; Mechanical analogy; Strategic decision making; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic process; Sports","van den Berg, L.; TELIT-SA, Faculty of Economic and Management Sciences, North-West University, Vanderbijlpark, P.O.

Although software systems in this domain have attracted researchers to develop a large body of knowledge on software architecture designs, there is no systematic analysis of this knowledge. Objective: This study aims to identify and synthesise state-of-the-art architectural elements including the design patterns, styles, views, quality attributes, and evaluation methodologies in the convergence of cloud computing and IoT. Method: We used systematic literature review (SLR) methodology for a detailed analysis of 82 primary studies of a total of 1618 studies. Results: We extracted six architectural design patterns in this domain; among them, edge connectivity patterns stand out as the most popular choice. The service-oriented architecture is the most frequently applied style in this context. Among all applicable quality attributes, scalability, timeliness, and security were the most investigated quality attributes. In addition, we included nine cross analyses to address the relationship between architectural patterns, styles, views, and evaluation methodologies with respect to different quality attributes and application areas. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that research on software architectures in this domain is increasing. Although few studies were found in which industrial evaluations were presented, industry requires more scientific and empirically validated design frameworks to guide software engineering in this domain.

The construction industry is also captivated with the idea of Industry 4.0 transformation that changes the traditional system into digital and cyberphysical system that interacts and connects across the geographical and organizational borders. However, as construction is commonly known as a low-technologically advanced industry, studies on Industry 4.0 in construction still remains elusive, as compared to other sectors such as manufacturing, electrical and electronic engineering and computer science. Therefore, this study aims to explore the current state of Industry 4.0 application from the construction engineering perspective. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify publications related to Industry 4.0 in construction. A bibliometric analysis has been outlined through exclusion and inclusion principles, while a scientometric analysis has been further applied to enhance the SLR findings through 'science mapping' visualization techniques. This study presents the relevance, along with the movement, adoption and adaption of Industry 4.0 in the construction industry that further enables the spark of new ideas, in effort to realize and comprehend the current and future technological transformation in construction. © 2020 The author(s).","Bibliometric analysis; Construction; Industry 4.0; Scientometric analysis; Systematic literature review","Construction industry; Embedded systems; Industry 4.0; Mapping; Bibliometric analysis; Construction engineering; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Electrical and electronic engineerings; Scientometric analysis; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technological development; Visualization technique; Electronics industry",,,"International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction",18744753,,,,"English","J.

Automated log-analysis techniques help software engineers gain insights into large log data. These techniques have several steps, among which log abstraction is the most important because it transforms raw log-data into high-level information. Thus, log abstraction allows software engineers to perform further analyses. Existing log-abstraction techniques vary significantly in their designs and performances. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that examines the performances of these techniques with respect to the following seven quality aspects concurrently: mode, coverage, delimiter independence, efficiency,scalability, system knowledge independence, and parameter tuning effort. Objectives: We want (1) to build a quality model for evaluating automated log-abstraction techniques and (2) to evaluate and recommend existing automated log-abstraction techniques using this quality model. Method: We perform a systematic literature review (SLR) of automated log-abstraction techniques. We review 89 research papers out of 2,864 initial papers. Results: Through this SLR, we (1) identify 17 automated log-abstraction techniques, (2) build a quality model composed of seven desirable aspects: mode, coverage, delimiter independence, efficiency, scalability, system knowledge independence, and parameter tuning effort, and (3) make recommendations for researchers on future research directions. Conclusion: Our quality model and recommendations help researchers learn about the state-of-the-art automated log-abstraction techniques, identify research gaps to enhance existing techniques, and develop new ones. We also support software engineers in understanding the advantages and limitations of existing techniques and in choosing the suitable technique to their unique use cases. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","AIOps; Data mining; Log Abstraction Techniques; Log Analysis; Log Management; Log Mining; Log Parsing; Quality Model; Software Analysis; Software Log; Systematic literature review; Systematic survey","Abstracting; Automation; Computer programming languages; Data mining; Efficiency; Engineers; Information management; Program debugging; Scalability; Software quality; Well logging; Abstraction techniques; AIOps; Log analysis; Log managements; Log mining; Log Parsing; Quality modeling; Software analysis; Systematic literature review; Quality control","Petrillo, F.; Départment d'Informatique et Mathématique, Université du Québec à ChicoutimiCanada; email: fabio@petrillo.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079518720

The purpose of this paper is to summarize current scientific knowledge on the phenomenon and to identify research outcomes, trends, and future research implications by conducting a systematic literature review (SLR). SLR is an explicit and reproducible method that ensures the reliability and traceability of the results. The selection of relevant papers was performed independently by each author using Rayyan QCRI software; the coding and analysis were conducted with the help of NVivo qualitative data analysis software. Findings show that the research area is largely represented by qualitative cases and optimization studies covering various aspects of dry ports. Dry port examples around the world differ based on location, functions, services, ownership, and maturity level. Although the research area is young and discrete, five main thematic areas are identified: debate on the concept, environmental impact, economic impact, performance impact, and dry ports from a network perspective. © 2020, The Author(s).","Dry port; Hinterland; Intermodal transportation; Seaport inland access; Systematic literature review",,"Roso, V.; Technology Management and Economics Department, Chalmers University of TechnologySweden; email: violeta.roso@chalmers.se",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",14792931,,,,"English","Marit.

At times when the geographic boundaries have become blurred due to the virtual connectivity and advancement in internet technology, South Korean popular culture is developing at an unprecedented rate across the globe. The popularity is such that it has entered the mainstream even competing with the Hollywood films, dramas and music. The field of Hallyu though has attracted many from the academia, as it is still a newer research area, not many significant attempts have been made to review the literature in a systematic manner. The major objective of this paper is to acquire a better understanding, and a detailed review of the research regarding Hallyu wave, its allied areas, current status and trends. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is the method used for this paper. This research has utilized the methods presented by Junior & Filho (2010), Jabbour (2013) and Seuring (2013). The researchers have deployed a systematic literature review approach to collect, analyze and synthesize data regarding the Hallyu wave, addressing a variety of topics using Google Scholar between 2000 and 2019 and selected 100 primary research articles. From the systematic literature review, the results or main gaps from the existing literature have been uncovered. For example: most of the low income countries do not have extensive research on Hallyu or most of the research on Hallyu is done in the region of East Asia and Pacific. © 2020 Amity University.","Cultural diplomacy; Cultural hybridity; Cultural proximity; Hallyu wave; Korean popular culture",,,,"Amity University",23957514,,,,"English","J.

Regardless of numerous benefits, the development of SOP still remnants in its infancy stage due to several interactive barriers. Some studies have been conducted to examine the barriers to SOP formation. However, no attempt has been reported so far to explore the multifaceted interrelationships amongst them. To bridge the gap, this study implements Interpretive Structural Model (ISM) approach to reconnoitre the interrelationships amongst the barriers in the context of SOP formation. The objective of this research paper is to develop a framework for modelling structural association amongst the barriers. To achieve the objective, we used a hybrid methodology based on systematic literature review (SLR), empirical survey, and ISM. Firstly, via SLR study, we identified 27 barriers to SOP formation. Secondly, to empirically explore the interrelationships amongst the identified barriers, a questionnaire survey was performed with 50 experts from a total of 20 different countries. Further, interrelationships amongst the barriers were identified using ISM via panel review, and their classifications were carried out via Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to the Classification Approach. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","client-vendor relationship; contract renovation; empirical study; interpretive structural modelling (ISM); software outsourcing partnership; systematic literature review","Mergers and acquisitions; Software engineering; Surveys; Client-vendor relationships; Empirical studies; Interpretive structural modelling (ISM); Software outsourcing; Systematic literature review; Outsourcing","Huang, J.; Department of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum (Beijing)China; email: huangjw@cup.edu.cn",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",20477481,,,,"English","J.

Methods An SLR of observational studies comparing safety outcomes of any DMARD with another intervention for the management of RA. A comparator group was required for inclusion. For treatments still without registry data (eg, sarilumab and the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors baricitinib, upadacitinib), randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and long-Term extensions (LTEs) were used. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed according to standard procedures. Results Forty-Two observational studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, addressing safety outcomes with bDMARDs and sDMARDs. Nine studies showed no difference in the risk of serious infections across bDMARDs and two studies (high RoB) showed an increased risk with bDMARDs compared with conventional synthetic (cs) DMARDs (adjusted incidence rate ratio 3.1-3.9). The risk of Herpes zoster infection was similar across bDMARDs, but one study showed an increased risk with tofacitinib compared with abatacept (adjusted HR (aHR) 2.0). Five studies showed no increased risk of cancer for bDMARDs compared with csDMARDs. An increased risk of lower intestinal perforation was found for tocilizumab compared with csDMARDs (aHR 4.5) and tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) (aHR 2.6-4.0). Sixty manuscripts reported safety data from RCTs/LTEs. Overall, no unexpected safety outcomes were found, except for the possibly increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) with JAK inhibitors. Conclusion Data obtained by this SLR confirm the known safety profile of bDMARDs. The risk of VTE in RA, especially in patients on JAK inhibitors, needs further evaluation. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

Through a systematic literature search (SLR) and metaanalysis, to determine maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancies involving systemic sclerosis (SSc), to analyze the effect of pregnancy on disease activity, and to examine predictors of fetal and maternal outcomes. Methods. An SLR was performed for articles on SSc and pregnancy published between 1950 and February 1, 2018. Reviewers double-extracted articles to obtain agreement on > 95% of predefined critical outcomes. Results. Out of 461 publications identified, 16 were included in the metaanalysis. The metaanalysis showed that pregnancies involving SSc were at higher risk of miscarriage (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.22-2.22), fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR; OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.21-4.53), preterm births (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.14-4.86), and newborns with low birth weight (OR 3.8, 95% CI 2.16-6.56). Patients with SSc had a 2.8 times higher chance of developing gestational hypertension (HTN; OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.28-3.39) and a 2.3 times higher chance of cesarean delivery compared to controls (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.37-3.8). The definitions of disease worsening/new visceral organ involvement were too inexact to have any confidence in the results, although worsening or new disease manifestations during pregnancy in 44/307 cases (14.3%) and 6 months postpartum in 32/306 cases (10.5%) were reported. The data did not permit definition of predictors of disease progression and of maternal and fetal outcomes. Conclusion. Pregnancies involving SSc have increased frequency of miscarriages, IUGR, preterm deliveries, and newborns with low birth weight compared to healthy controls. Women with SSc were more prone to develop gestational HTN and to undergo cesarean delivery. Disease manifestations seem to remain stable or improve in most patients. Copyright © 2020.

Methods A systematic literature research (SLR) to investigate the efficacy of any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (conventional synthetic (cs)DMARD, biological (b) and biosimilar DMARD, targeted synthetic (ts)DMARD) or glucocorticoid (GC) therapy in patients with RA was done by searching MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library for articles published between 2016 and 8 March 2019. Results 234 abstracts were selected for detailed assessment, with 136 finally included. They comprised the efficacy of bDMARDs versus placebo or other bDMARDs, efficacy of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (JAKi) across different patient populations and head-To-head of different bDMARDs versus JAKi or other bDMARDs. Switching of bDMARDs to other bDMARDs or tsDMARDs, strategic trials and tapering studies of bDMARDs, csDMARDs and JAKi were assessed. The drugs evaluated included abatacept, adalimumab, ABT-122, baricitinib, certolizumab pegol, SBI-087, CNTO6785, decernotinib, etanercept, filgotinib, golimumab, GCs, GS-9876, guselkumab, hydroxychloroquine, infliximab, leflunomide, mavrilimumab, methotrexate, olokizumab, otilimab, peficitinib, rituximab, sarilumab, salazopyrine, secukinumab, sirukumab, tacrolimus, tocilizumab, tofacitinib, tregalizumab, upadacitinib, ustekinumab and vobarilizumab. The efficacy of many bDMARDs and tsDMARDs was shown. Switching to another tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) or non-TNFi bDMARDs after TNFi treatment failure is efficacious. Tapering of DMARDs is possible in patients achieving long-standing stringent clinical remission; in patients with residual disease activity (including patients in LDA) the risk of flares is increased during the tapering. Biosimilars are non-inferior to their reference products. Conclusion This SLR informed the task force regarding the evidence base of various therapeutic regimen for the development of the update of EULAR's RA management recommendation. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

There are many terms used to describe the process of reducing GHGs, including decarbonization, low carbon development (LCD) or low carbon transition (LCT). The conceptualization of these terms remains puzzling and there has not been any consensus to explain the meaning and their interrelationship. Clearer definition and conceptual boundaries are necessary to improve the coherence of overarching practices to cut CO2 emission. The paper aims to review key concepts related to climate change mitigation related to the reduction of CO2 and efforts toward net-zero emission in the academic literature, by (1) examining progress of the literature over time, (2) identifying geographical locus and sectoral focus of the literature, (3) determining the interrelationships between the key concepts. We use a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for data collection by selecting peer-reviewed literature from Scopus and analyzing the data with content analysis and bibliometric analysis. The findings are, firstly, the publications of the literature are influenced by global and national climate change policies and the interest of scholars affiliated to institutions from major emitter countries. Therefore, the literature is mostly originating from countries that emit the most CO2 while also implement mitigations to reduce CO2 emission. Secondly, China is the country where studies are mostly focused and also where the authors are affiliated/located. However, publications from the United Kingdom are cited the most. Thirdly, there are three clusters of literature found, namely that LCD and LCT are the terms used to identify visions for climate mitigation, while decarbonization is the actions and processes to achieve either LCD or LCT (as the visions). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Decarbonization; Low carbon development; Low carbon transition; Systematic literature review","Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Global warming; Academic literature; Bibliometric analysis; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Low-carbon development; Low-carbon transitions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Greenhouse gases","Wimbadi, R.W.; United Nations University - Institute for the Advanced Study of Sustainability (UNU-IAS), 5-53-70, Jingumae, Shibuya-ku, Japan; email: ramanditya@student.unu.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The growing literature on the PI and its noteworthy potential to be a disruptive innovation in the logistics industry call for a systematic literature review (SLR), which we conducted that defines the current state of the literature and outlines future research directions and approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The SLR that was undertaken included journal publications, conference papers and proceedings, book excerpts, industry reports and white papers. We conducted descriptive, citation, thematic and methodological analyses to understand the evolution of PI literature. Findings: Based on the literature review and analyses, we proposed a comprehensive framework that structures the PI domain and outlines future directions for logistics and SCM researchers. Research limitations/implications: Our research findings are limited by the relatively low number of journal publications, as the PI is a new field of inquiry that is composed primarily of conference papers and proceedings. Originality/value: The proposed PI-based framework identifies seven PI themes, including the respective facilitators and barriers, which can inform researchers and practitioners on future potentially disruptive SC strategies. © 2019, Horst Treiblmaier, Kristijan Mirkovski, Paul Benjamin Lowry and Zach G.

Several studies applied musculoskeletal ultrasound in this setting, however, its role in helping diagnosis has yet to be clearly defined. The purpose of this work is to systematically assess the diagnostic applications of ultrasonography in early arthritis in order to summarize the available evidence and highlight possible gaps in knowledge. Methods: In December 2017, existing systematic literature reviews (SLR) on rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), and gout were retrieved. Studies on ultrasound to diagnose the target conditions and detecting elementary lesions (such as synovitis, tenosynovitis, enthesitis, bone erosions, osteophytes) were extracted from the SLRs. The searches of the previous reviews were updated and data from new studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria extracted. Groups of reviewers worked separately for each disease, when possible diagnostic accuracy (sensitivities, specificities) was calculated from primary studies. When available, the reliability of ultrasound to detect elementary lesions was extracted. Results: For all the examined disease, recent SLRs were available. The new searches identified 27 eligible articles, with 87 articles included from the previous SLRs. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound in identifying diseases was addressed by 75 studies; in most of them, a single elementary lesion was used to define diagnosis, except for PMR. Only studies on RA included consecutive patients with new onset of arthritis, while studies on gout and CPPD often focused on subjects with mono-arthritis. Most of the remaining studies enrolled patients with a defined diagnosis. Synovitis was the most frequently detected lesion; clinical diagnosis was the most common reference standard. The diagnostic performance of ultrasound across different conditions was extremely variable. Ultrasound to identify elementary lesions was assessed in 38 studies in OA, gout and CPPD. Its performance in OA was very variable, with better results in CPPD and gout. The reliability of ultrasound was moderate to good for most lesions. Conclusions: Although a consistent amount of literature investigated the diagnostic application of ultrasound, in only a minority of cases its additional value over clinical diagnosis was tested.

When these narratives become increasingly complex, pragmatics analysis (i.e., at discourse or argumentation levels) assisted by software is a great ally in the digital humanities. In recent years, solutions have been developed from the information visualization domain to support discourse analysis or argumentation analysis of textual sources via software, with applications in political speeches, debates, online forums, but also in written narratives, literature or historical sources. This paper presents a wide and interdisciplinary systematic literature review (SLR), both in software-related areas and humanities areas, on the information visualization and the software solutions adopted to support pragmatics textual analysis. As a result of this review, this paper detects weaknesses in existing works on the field, especially related to solutions' availability, pragmatic framework dependence and lack of information sharing and reuse software mechanisms. The paper also provides some software guidelines for improving the detected weaknesses, exemplifying some guidelines in practice through their implementation in a new web tool, Viscourse. Viscourse is conceived as a complementary tool to assist textual analysis and to facilitate the reuse of informational pieces from discourse and argumentation text analysis tasks. © 2020 by the authors.","Argumentation analysis; Discourse analysis; Information reuse; Information visualization; Software assistance; Systematic literature review; Viscourse","Application programs; Humanities computing; Information analysis; Information systems; Visualization; Humanities research; Information sharing and reuse; Information visualization; Intrinsic characteristics; Software mechanisms; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technological supports; Computer software reusability","Martin-Rodilla, P.; Information Retrieval Lab (IRLab), Facultade de Informática, University of A CoruñaSpain; email: patricia.martin.rodilla@udc.es",,"MDPI AG",20782489,,,,"English","Information",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085389056

Methods: We performed an SLR on PubMed, Central, Cochrane, and French databases from January 2000 to December 2018. The search focused on cost-effectiveness/utility/benefit analyses. We extracted data on treatment sequences, outcomes (e.g. quality-adjusted life year) and choices of economic evaluation methods (e.g. model type, type of analysis, and method of utility estimation). We analysed the improvement of methods by comparing two sub-periods (2000–2009 and 2010–2018). The quality of reporting and the quality of the methods were assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) and a set of eight key aspects for a reference case for economic evaluation of bDMARDs based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) and Drummond checklists. Data extraction and study assessment were performed independently by two health economists. Results: From the 824 records identified in the initial search, 51 publications were selected. Of these, 31 included sequences. Individual models such as discrete-event simulations were used in over two-fifths (22/51, 43%) of the selected studies. Few studies (7/51, 14%) used utility scores based on generic instruments (e.g. EQ-5D). Estimation of hospitalization costs was described in only approximately one-third of studies (19/51). Loss of quality of life (QoL) related to adverse events such as tuberculosis and pneumonia was included in one-tenth (5/51, 10%) of the studies. It was difficult to compare the results of the economic evaluations (i.e. incremental cost-effectiveness ratios) due to the high heterogeneity of studies in terms of disease stage, data sources, inputs, and methods of health outcome assessment used. For identified studies including sequences, the CHEERS assessment of reporting quality showed insufficient reporting of uncertainty analyses and utility weights in more than a third of the studies (11/31, 35%; 9/25, 36%). An in-depth assessment of the quality of the studies revealed that only seven, mostly conducted during the sub-period 2010–2018, addressed the majority of methodological quality assessment issues such as the simulation of patient sequence pathways, the use of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of comparative effectiveness, the choice of treatment sequence, and rules for switching. Conclusion: Our SLR identified a lack of high-quality evaluations assessing bDMARD sequences, although some improvements were made in the reporting and modelling of patients’ pathways in studies published after 2010. In order to improve economic evaluations of RA, clear health technology assessment guidance on RA health-related QoL instruments must be provided, and data including long-term disease progression must be made available. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"biological product; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; biological therapy; clinical outcome; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; cost minimization analysis; cost utility analysis; disease severity; economic evaluation; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; hospitalization cost; human; patient simulation; pneumonia; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; tuberculosis","Ghabri, S.; Department of Economic and Public Health Evaluation, French National Authority for Health (Haute Autorité de Santé, HAS), 5 Avenue du Stade de France, France; email: s.ghabri@has-sante.fr",,"Adis",11707690,,PARME,"32052376","English","Pharmacoeconomics",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079382768

Business intelligence system (BIS) is one of the top prioritized technologies that attracted the significant attention of policy-makers and industry experts due to its ability to provide more informed and intelligent knowledge for decision-making processes. It is evident by literature that organizations and industries are prone to integrate the BIS at large scale, but more than 70% BIS projects fail to give the expected results. Hence, it is pertinent to explore the significant determinants that influence the BIS adoption and acceptance in organizations. Although previous literature did not have any comprehensive review relevant to the individual, technological, organizational, and environmental determinants. Therefore, the current study tries to narrow this gap by a systematic literature review (SLR) of 84 studies that were published during the period of 2011-2020. A total of 93 determinants are identified based on content analysis by using text mining techniques of Yoshikoder and human coding skills. The identified determinants are ranked according to their frequency of use. A theoretical framework has been developed with potential determinants and theories. The study results will enrich the recent BIS literature and improve the understanding of practitioners' decision-making processes to leverage maximum value from the adoption of BIS. © 2020 by the authors.","Acceptance; Adoption; Business intelligence systems; Determinants; Theories",,"Tlili, I.; Department for Management of Science and Technology Development, Ton Duc Thang UniversityViet Nam; email: iskander.tlili@tdtu.edu.vn",,"MDPI AG",20763417,,,,"English","Appl.

METHODS: A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed in January 2018 to identify published studies and conference abstracts evaluating biologic DMARD response according to ACPA status. Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis methods were used to pool risk ratios (RRs). In the base-case, treatment response was assessed using EULAR measure, while a scenario analysis assessed response by combining ACR20, DAS28 and EULAR measures. Subgroup analyses were performed for duration of study follow-up. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 30 SLR studies were included in the meta-analysis. The base-case showed a statistically significant positive association between ACPA positivity and EULAR response for patients treated with abatacept (RR: 1.13 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.26]), while ACPA positivity was associated with lower EULAR responses to TNF-α-i (RR: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.84, 0.98]). For the scenario analysis, results were consistent with the base-case for abatacept (RR 1.18 [95% CI 1.03, 1.35]), while for TNFα-i, no significant difference by ACPA status was observed (RR 0.97 [95% CI 0.86, 1.10]). Subgroups analyses showed results similar to the base-case for both abatacept and TNF-α-i. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirms that ACPA-positive RA patients are marginally more likely to achieve EULAR and ACR20 response to abatacept compared to ACPA-negative patients. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates that there is no association between ACPA status and response to TNF-α-i, consistent with findings of previously published studies.",,,,,"NLM (Medline)",0392856X,,,"31770089","English","Clin.

The traditional solutions do not fit the new challenges brought by the IoT ecosystem. Although the development's area of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) provides an opportunity to improve security issues and create a fertile and exciting environment for further research and experiments, there is not any systematic and comprehensive study about analyzing its importance for IoT environment. Therefore, this work aims to identify, evaluate, and perform a comprehensive study of empirical research on the studies of AIS approaches to secure the IoT environment. The relevant and high-quality studies are addressing using three research questions about the main research motivations, existing solutions, and future gaps and directions. The AIS approaches have been divided into three main categories based on IoT layers, and detailed classifications have also been included based on different parameters. To achieve this aim, the authors use a systematic literature review (SLR) as a powerful method to collect and critically analyze the research papers. Also, the authors discuss the selected studies and their main techniques, as well as their benefits and drawbacks in general.

Mauritius is considering embarking on a smart island initiative, and as such, the existing towns in Mauritius have a major role to play in the transformation process. This study aims to focus on a systematic analysis of ICT architectures. This study proposes recommendations with regard to ICT infrastructures. This study elicits the contribution of those services towards the overall transformation of the towns, which in turn will form an integral part of the smart island initiative of the country. Design/methodology/approach: A first step towards developing a smart ICT architecture is to understand what a smart ICT architecture constitutes of and the frameworks that can be used to develop these architectures. The main objectives of this systematic literature review (SLR) are as follows: understand what a smart ICT architecture consists of and derive a definition that will be used throughout the research for the development of ICT architecture for the smart local councils for Mauritius; analyse various frameworks, architectures and models that have been used in existing literature for the development of smart ICT architectures. Findings: This SLR was conducted with a view to investigate ICT architectures with respect to smart governance. An in-depth review, followed by a critical analysis was performed based on the research questions set. The contribution of this study include the formulation of a definition for ICT architecture for smart local councils, which can be applied to any sphere characterised by similar aspects with reference to smart local governance. Albeit existing frameworks such as The Open Group Architecture Framework, Federal Enterprise Architecture and Zachman Framework, it was observed that in most cases, ICT architectures were built from scratch potentially because of specificities of each country/city.

Design/methodology/approach: To address this gap, this systematic literature review (SRL) provides an overview on what MSPs are and how they influence farmers' innovation in emerging economies. Findings: The selected sample included n = 44 publications in 2004–2018, focussing for 70% on Africa, with minor shares in Latin America and Asia, and with a strong theoretical and methodological segmentation across five sub-disciplines (agribusiness management, agricultural economics, agricultural innovation systems, agricultural research for development and public policy and governance). Overall, this SRL leads to three findings. First, a key distinctive organizational feature of MSPs relative to other novel organizational forms in emerging economies entails the presence of a virtual and/or physical interface spanning across multiple heterogeneous stakeholders. Second, in relation to their impact pathways towards farmers' innovation, MSPs tend to achieve different intermediary outcomes and levels of innovation depending on their organizational goals and activities. Research limitations/implications: These findings also reveal four key limitations of the extant MSP literature – namely, disciplinary silos thinking, linear thinking, limited focus on the role of informal institutions and little emphasis on power dynamics – which could inform managers and policy makers on how MSPs could influence farmers; innovation. Originality/value: This study offers a SLR with the goal of providing practitioners and academics with first, a holistic view of the available research on the impact of MSPs on farmers innovation, and second, propose an impact pathway framework to understand how and under which circumstances MSPs support farmers' innovation given their functioning, structure and the governance mechanisms of MSPs. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Farmers’ innovation; Impact pathways; Multi-stakeholder platforms; Rural development",,"Barzola Iza, C.L.; Department of Business Management and Organisation, Wageningen University and ResearchNetherlands; email: lbarzola@espol.edu.ec",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20440839,,,,"English","J.

Methods: Randomized controlled trials reporting induction and maintenance efficacy of anti-TNFs (infliximab [IFX], adalimumab [ADA], golimumab [GOL]), vedolizumab (VDZ), tofacitinib (TOF) or UST were identified through a systematic literature review (SLR). Analyses were conducted for clinical response, clinical remission and endoscopic-mucosal healing for populations with and without failure of prior biologics (non-biologic failure [NBF]; biologic failure [BF]). Maintenance data from trials with re-randomized response designs were re-calculated to correspond to treat-through arms. Bayesian network meta-analyses (NMA) were conducted to obtain posterior distribution probabilities for UST to perform better than comparators. Results: Six trials included NBF patients and four included BF patients. In NBF patients, UST as a 1-year regimen showed higher probabilities of clinical response, remission and endoscopic-mucosal healing vs. all treatments: Bayesian probabilities of UST being better than active therapies ranged from 91% (VDZ) to 100% (ADA) for response; 82% (VDZ) to 99% (ADA) for remission and 82% (IFX) to 100% (ADA and GOL) for endoscopic-mucosal healing. In BF patients, UST was the most effective treatment (Q8W dose); however, effect sizes were smaller than in the NBF population. Conclusions: Results indicate a higher likelihood of response, remission and endoscopic-mucosal healing at 1 year with UST vs. comparators in the NBF population. In BF patients, a higher likelihood of response to UST vs. the most comparators was also observed, although results were more uncertain. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Although classical methods of RS have achieved remarkable successes in providing item recommendations, they still suffer from many issues such as cold start and data sparsity. With the recent achievements of deep learning in various applications such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image processing, more efforts have been made by the researchers to exploit deep learning methods for improving the performance of RS. However, despite the several research works on deep learning based RS, very few secondary studies were conducted in the field. Therefore, this study aims to provide a systematic literature review (SLR) of deep learning based RSs that can guide researchers and practitioners to better understand the new trends and challenges in the field. This paper is the first SLR specifically on the deep learning based RS to summarize and analyze the existing studies based on the best quality research publications. The paper particularly adopts an SLR approach based on the standard guidelines of the SLR designed by Kitchemen-ham which uses selection method and provides detail analysis of the research publications. Several publications were gathered and after inclusion/exclusion criteria and the quality assessment, the selected papers were finally used for the review. The results of the review indicated that autoencoder (AE) models are the most widely exploited deep learning architectures for RS followed by the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) models. Also, the results showed that Movie Lenses is the most popularly used datasets for the deep learning-based RS evaluation followed by the Amazon review datasets. Based on the results, the movie and e-commerce have been indicated as the most common domains for RS and that precision and Root Mean Squared Error are the most commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep leaning based RSs. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Collaborative filtering; Deep learning; Recommender system; Survey; Systematic literature review","Collaborative filtering; Electronic commerce; Image enhancement; Learning algorithms; Mean square error; Natural language processing systems; Recommender systems; Recurrent neural networks; Surveying; Convolutional neural network; Information overloads; Learning architectures; NAtural language processing; Recurrent neural network (RNNs); Root mean squared errors; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Deep learning","Da’u, A.; Hassan Usman Katsina PolytechnicNigeria; email: dauaminu@gmail.com",,"Springer",02692821,,AIRVE,,"English","Artif Intell Rev",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083542503

It offers on demand, pay per use access to infrastructure, platforms, and applications. Due to the increase in its popularity, the huge number of requests need to be handled in an efficient manner. Task scheduling as one of the challenges in the cloud computing supports the requests for assigning a particular resource so as to perform effectively. In the resource management, task scheduling is performed where there is the dependency between tasks. Many approaches and case studies have been developed for the scheduling of these tasks. Up to now, a systematic literature review (SLR) has not been presented to discover and evaluate the task scheduling approaches in the cloud computing environment. To overcome, this paper presents an SLR-based analysis on the task scheduling approaches that classify into (a) single cloud environments that evaluate cost-aware, energy-aware, multi-objective, and QoS-aware approaches in task scheduling; (b) multicloud environment that evaluates cost-aware, multi-objective, and QoS-aware task scheduling; and (c) mobile cloud environment that is energy-aware and QoS-aware task scheduling.

Various problems such as noise problems, poor performance, short duration, spoofing, and inconsistency are problems that need to be resolved immediately. The researchers researched various models from traditional methods such as the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to the Deep Learning methods using Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Besides, various hybrid deep learning methods are also used. Various papers that use these methods are difficult to understand, especially when compared between one method with another to obtain novelty and direction of research on speaker recognition. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) helps identify and interpret various findings in a field of research in answering the research questions that have determined. This paper uses SLR in identifying research trends, datasets, feature extraction, classification methods, and evaluation techniques used in speaker recognition using deep learning. Results of the SLR discussion are 82 major study journals from 2011 to 2019 show that 20% of research studies focus on speaker verification topics, 11.5% each at Speaker Recognition in Noisy Conditions, Speaker Emotion Recognition and Short and Mismatch Utterance Duration. Research in speaker recognition 90% used public datasets and 10% used private datasets. The MFCC method is a method often used in feature extraction although there are I-vector and X-Vector methods that are starting to be used in deep learning. Deep Neural Network is a classification method that is often used in speaker recognition. 31% of the evaluation techniques that are often used are Equal Error Rate, 29% used the Word Error Rate and 40% used others method such as Accuracy, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Character Error Rate (CER), Phone Error Rate (PER) and Speech Separation Performance (SSP). © 2020 Polish Forest Society.

A recent 5-year comparative study prompted this review of its impact in this very severe population. Previous systematic literature reviews (SLR) cited concerns in terms of missing studies or patient duplication. Methods: This SLR addressed these criticisms, assessed all outcomes of longer-term adjunctive VNS in all studies, irrespective of TRD severity, comparing where feasible with treatment-as-usual (TAU). We searched for adult VNS+TAU studies (January 1, 2000 to June 24, 2019). Comparative and single-arm studies were eligible. All reported efficacy, safety and quality of life (QOL) outcomes were assessed. Where possible, meta-analysis was used to calculate overall pooled effect estimates across studies at several time points. Results: Of 22 identified studies, there were two randomized controlled (RCT), sixteen single-arm and four non-randomized comparative studies. Numerous depression-specific, safety and QOL measures were reported. Meta-analysis was possible for three efficacy [Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Clinician Global Impression-Improvement, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression] and three safety [serious adverse events, study drop-outs and all-cause mortality] but no QOL measures. Data beyond 2 years was not poolable. Analyses demonstrated that antidepressant benefits improved to 24 months and safety issues were minimal. Heterogeneity was high and statistically significant. Conclusions: Despite limitations in the evidence base, our comprehensive summary of VNS+TAU outcomes suggests that this treatment provides improving benefit and hope for this very hard-to-treat chronic population. More comparative TRD studies should describe safety and QOL. © 2020 The Authors","Long-term outcomes; Meta-analysis; Systematic review; Treatment resistant depression; Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapy","all cause mortality; clinical assessment tool; clinical effectiveness; Clinician Global Impression Improvement; comparative study; disease severity; feasibility study; human; meta analysis; Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; observational study; outcome assessment; patient safety; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; statistical significance; systematic review; treatment resistant depression; vagus nerve stimulation","Bottomley, J.M.; Amygdala LimitedUnited Kingdom; email: jmb@amygdala.uk.com",,"W.B.

The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical characteristics of anti-EJ associated ILD in a large cohort of patients. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients with anti-EJ associated ILD. All available data of clinical and laboratory characteristics, pulmonary function tests, laboratory parameters, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and treatment were collected and analyzed from medical records. Results: We identified 51 subjects. Average age at diagnosis was 55.6 years. Thirty-two of 51 patients were female. Concurrent autoantibodies against Ro52 were seen in 92.2% patients studied. HRCT patterns were mainly non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). The predominant myositis subset was amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM) (41.2%) followed by dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Thirty-four patients improved on corticosteroids alone or in combination with immunosuppressive drugs as treatment and ten patients were stabilized. However, eleven patients (21.6%) initially improved during 12.0 ± 4.4 months, then progressively recurred despite steroid treatment (mean prednisone dose 11.6 ± 3.5 mg). The recurrence group included a significantly higher proportion of patients with NSIP pattern (p < 0.05). In the literature review the most common manifestations of anti-EJ ASS were ILD (89.3%) and myositis (58.9%). Conclusion: ILD are common features of the anti-EJ ASS. Patients with anti-EJ ILD often had an onset of ILD with lower lung-predominant opacities and NSIP. Although the disease responded well to the initial combination therapy of corticosteroid and immunosuppressant, recurrence was frequent. NSIP pattern was significantly more frequent in the recurrence group. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-EJ antibody; Antisynthetase syndrome; Interstitial lung disease","autoantibody; azathioprine; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporine; glucocorticoid; immunosuppressive agent; La antibody; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisone; Ro antibody; ro52 antibody; Sm antibody; tacrolimus; unclassified drug; antisynthetase syndrome; Article; bronchiectasis; clinical feature; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; corticosteroid therapy; coughing; dermatomyositis; disease association; disease course; dyspnea; fever; follow up; human; interstitial lung disease; interstitial pneumonia; lung function test; monotherapy; muscle weakness; myalgia; polymyositis; priority journal; retrospective study; systematic review; treatment response","Dai, J.; Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Drum Tower Clinical Medical College of Nanjing Medical University, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, China; email: daijinghong@nju.edu.cn",,"W.B.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors that influence ERMS adoption in the Yemeni oil and gas (O&G) sector. Design/methodology/approach: This paper conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) to extract the most common factors that could facilitate successful ERMS adoption. Information technology (IT) experts were asked to rank the extracted factors via an e-mail questionnaire and to recommend specific critical success factors that must be given extra attention to increasing the success of ERMS adoption. Essentially, the proposed methodology is technology-organization-environment (TOE) modeling to examine the important factors influencing decision-makers in the Yemeni O&G sector regarding ERMS adoption. Findings: This paper identifies factors influencing ERMS adoption based on SLR and an expert-ranking survey. The data that were collected from IT experts were analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences. The results showed that only 12 out of 20 factors were significant. The experts then added three new factors, resulting in 15 significant factors classified into the three dimensions as follows: technology, organization and environment. Originality/value: Limited studies have been carried out in the context of the O&G sector, even among developed countries such as Canada, the UK and Australia. These studies have focused on a limited number of factors for ERMS adoption targeting better utilization of human resources, faster and more user-friendly system responses and suitability for organizational ease.

Throughout this paper frugal innovation is reported as a phenomenon, concept, research field and strategy, showing the different ways the literature refers to it and how scattered the concept is. However, based on the understanding, the authors decided to address frugal innovation as a kind of innovation strategy that helps companies to innovate in resource-constrained environments. Therefore, considering the increasing interest in the frugal innovation topic and adding the perspective of business strategy for resource-constrained conditions, the research question addressed in this paper is: what are the main features of the frugal innovation literature that unfold its current perspectives for business strategy? In this sense, the purpose of this study is to analyze the scientific production in frugal innovation through a literature mapping and review to better understand it, delimiting different perspectives and creating boundaries to other business strategies or approaches. Design/methodology/approach: The authors performed a co-citation analysis using the Vosviewer software to notice how authors are arranged in clusters based on their understanding of the topic. Furthermore, the authors also performed a systematic literature review (SLR) analyzing the extant literature on frugal innovation based on the clusters found through the co-citation method. The final sample used in the study included 42 papers published between 2011 and 2019, using the Web of Science platform as a data source. Findings: By means of SLR, the findings of this study provided a more organized view of frugal innovation through the co-citation analysis and the qualitative analysis of the clusters, which were the basis for the parameters established. After the conceptualization of frugal innovation strategy (FIS) and the delimitation of boundaries of FIS, the authors bring the reflections about the contribution to the literature and the practice (managers and society) by showing three assumptions to be tested and confirmed in future studies and a framework to guide companies in search of a FIS. Originality/value: This study contributes to the discussion on frugal innovation moving a step forward to clarify the research field on this subject providing the main characteristics for researchers and practitioners. The paper has delimited the boundaries of FIS. The assumptions established in the discussion can become hypotheses for empirical studies. In addition, the authors explain why, what is, where and to whom the FIS can be developed and applied. Furthermore, the authors contribute by developing the FIS framework, with four strategic positions based on the boundaries of FIS organized by the complexity technological level. The strategic positions are frugal innovation orientation (FIO), FIO to value shared, FIO to market and FIS. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bibliometric mapping; Co-citation analysis; Frugal innovation; Strategy; Systematic literature review",,"Santos, L.L.; Faculdade de Economia, Administração e Contabilidade, Universidade de Sao PauloBrazil; email: leandrolima@usp.br",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20596014,,,,"English","Rev.

Methods Eight clinical questions based on two criteria guided the SLR: (1) adults≥50 years at high risk of osteoporotic fracture and (2) interventions delivered by non-physician health professionals to prevent and manage osteoporotic fractures. Interventions focused on diagnostic procedures to identify risk of falling, therapeutic approaches and implementation strategies. Outcomes included fractures, falls, risk of falling and change in bone mineral density. Systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials were preferentially selected. Data were synthesised using a qualitative descriptive approach. Results Of 15 917 records, 43 articles were included. Studies were clinically and methodologically diverse. We identified sufficient evidence that structured exercise, incorporating progressive resistance training delivered to people who had undergone hip fracture surgery, and multicomponent exercise, delivered to people at risk of primary fracture, reduced risk of falling. The effectiveness of multidisciplinary fracture liaison services in reducing refracture rate was confirmed. There was insufficient evidence found to support the effectiveness of nutrients and falls prevention programmes in this patient population. Conclusion Despite study heterogeneity, our SLR showed beneficial effects of some interventions delivered by non-physician health professionals and the positive impact of multidisciplinary team working and patient educational approaches to prevent and manage osteoporotic fractures.

As a result of the needs of developers, new development methodologies have emerged. However, that does not mean that companies always implement an optimal development process; instead, there are several disadvantages presented by an inadequate and not versatile methodologies. Objective: The aim is to compare web development methodologies based on dynamic features presented during the life cycle to identify their use, relevance, and characteristics. The process employing is an SLR and field research to Ecuadorian development companies. Method: The method used is a systematic literature review (SLR) for the identification of characteristics and processes of development methodologies. Additionally, a survey of Ecuadorian web application developers was implemented to assess the importance of using a method during the project. Results: The literature review exhibited as a result that UWE and OOHDM have greater flexibility than other methodologies before dynamic environments during the web development process. On the other hand, within field research was obtained that companies use different software development methods than those assessed in the study (hybrid methodologies). However, within the range of companies using the compared methodologies, UWE is the most selected. Conclusions: Each methodology holds particular features and employment environment, which makes them useful in specific conditions. Through the field research, it is possible to conclude that most of the companies use different methodologies than the evaluated ones; thus, the process is guided by hybrids methods or models based on experience. On the other hand, through the SLR, we identified UWE as the most suitable methodology for web development under dynamic environments, such as the size of the company, the need to modify the requirements, or the knowledge that the development team has about the process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agile methodologies; Comparison; Development methodologies; Web applications","Life cycle; Agile Methodologies; Comparison; Development methodology; Dynamic environments; Hybrid methodologies; Software development methods; Systematic literature review (SLR); WEB application; Software design","Molina-Ríos, J.; Civil Engineering Faculty, Technical University of MachalaEcuador; email: jmolina@utmachala.edu.ec",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075759435

Software development in projects also hugely depends on effective interaction between people, and human factors have been identified as key to successful software projects. Especially in this context, managing and analyzing social networks is highly important. The instrument of social network analysis (SNA) provides fine-grained methods for analyzing social networks in project teams, going beyond the traditional tools and techniques of project management. This paper examines the importance of the application of SNA in software development projects. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of research on software development projects and social network data published between 1980 and 2019. We identified and analyzed 86 relevant studies, finding that research on software development projects spans the topics of project organization, communication management, knowledge management, version and configuration management, requirement management, and risk management. Further, we show that most studies focus on project organization and that the most common method used to gather social data relies on automated extraction from various software development repositories in the SNA context. Our paper contributes to the software development literature by providing a broad overview of published studies on the use of social networks in helping software development projects. Finally, we identify research opportunities and make suggestions for addressing existing research gaps. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","project management; Social networks; social networks analysis; software development; systematic literature review","Application programs; Behavioral research; Decision making; Human resource management; Knowledge management; Project management; Research and development management; Risk management; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Communication management; Configuration management; Effective interactions; Requirement management; Research opportunities; Software development projects; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

However, the widespread use of mobile applications by teenagers suggests that they could be a more suitable tool for this purpose. This paper reviews the methodologies for promoting physical activities to healthy teenagers explored in different studies, excluding the analysis of different diseases. We found only nine studies working with teenagers and mobile applications to promote active lifestyles, including the focus on nutrition and physical activity. Studies report using different techniques to captivate the teenagers, including questionnaires and gamification techniques. We identified the common features used in different studies, which are: paper diary, diet diary, exercise diary, notifications, diet plan, physical activity registration, gamification, smoking cessation, pictures, game, and SMS, among others. © 2020 by the authors.

Until now, many researchers have already paid attention to the improvement in the indoor environment for older adults, but few researchers notice that neighborhood environment also plays a critical role in the quality of life (QoL) of older adults, especially older adults who are aging in place. This article aims to explore the complex inner relationship between neighborhood environment and QoL of older adults based on systematic literature review (SLR) and interpretative structural modeling (ISM). All neighborhood environmental factors related to QoL of older adults are searched, screened, quality assessed, counted, and then identified according to SLR protocol. Then, based on the questionnaire survey and the one-to-one interview, the ISM of all identified neighborhood environmental factors is established to clarify the inner relationship among those factors in urban areas, and the role of each neighborhood environmental factor is analyzed by MICMAC analysis. This inner relationship among neighborhood environmental factors can provide valuable retrofit strategies of neighborhood environment to improve QoL of older adults efficiently. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Inner relationship; Neighborhood environment; Older adults; Quality of life; SLR–ISM","adult; aging population; environmental factor; literature review; neighborhood; quality of life","Li, D.; School of Civil Engineering, Engineering Research Center of Building Equipment, Energy, and Environment, Southeast UniversityChina; email: njldz@seu.edu.cn",,"Springer",15664910,,JHBEA,,"English","J.

Through smart homes, household appliances as the Internet of Things (IoT) devices can easily be handled and monitored from a far distance by remote controls. With the day-to-day popularity of smart homes, it is anticipated that the number of connections rises faster. With this remarkable rise in connections, some issues such as substantial data volumes, security weaknesses, and response time disorders are predicted. In order to solve these obstacles and suggest an auspicious solution, fog computing as an eminently distributed architecture has been proposed to administer the massive, security-crucial, and delay-sensitive data, which are produced by communications of the IoT devices in smart homes. Indeed, fog computing bridges space between various IoT appliances and cloud-side servers and brings the supply side (cloud layer) to the demand side (user device layer). By utilizing fog computing architecture in smart homes, the issues of traditional architectures can be solved. This paper proposes a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method for fog-based smart homes (published between 2014 and May 2019). A practical taxonomy based on the contents of the present research studies is represented as resource-management-based and service-management-based approaches. This paper also demonstrates an abreast comparison of the aforementioned solutions and assesses them under the same evaluation factors.

Creating software products that take the user experience (UX) into account as an essential requirement in the software development process is a necessary activity for all information technology (IT) professionals looking to build quality products. Currently, there are few initiatives that address the insertion of innovative techniques in the curriculum of undergraduate IT courses during the training of students. Design sprint (DS) in conjunction with project-based learning (PBL) provides an effective method to achieve the quality of software products when using UX techniques and creativity. One of the key features of PBL is the ability to generate artifacts with your application to solve real and non-trivial problems. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to investigate the hypothesis that joining the DS concepts with PBL identifies the user experience as one of the main attributes of quality and authenticity to be achieved in the software development projects. The objective of the SLR is to analyze how the PBL units that produce authentic software are executed. Furthermore, two case studies are reported that explore how DS behaves in a reduced number of classes when it is desired to generate a functional prototype that will be developed in a PBL unit. As a result of the SLR, it has been identified that Scrum is the software development process most used in PBL units that generate authentic software. The identified works report that the students are usually divided into groups of 2–5 people during the activities and the monitors play an important role in the quality of the software produced. The result of the case study indicates that the limited time for PBL conduction was a complicating factor in this adaptation and that students feel that their own learning and participation are positive in DS-based classes, as well as that DS provides insights that may be useful in a PBL context. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Active learning; Authentic software; Design sprint; Project-based learning; Systematic literature review; User experience","Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Product design; Students; Technical presentations; Active Learning; Information technology professionals; Project based learning; Project-based learning approach; Software development projects; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); User experience; Software design","Canedo, E.D.; Department of Computer Science, University of Brasília (UnB), P.O.

This article contributes to the 'end of theory' discussions, which have intensified in the social sciences since the widening practice of big data and computational methods. Adopting a systematic literature review of 120 empirical articles through a combined quantitative and qualitative approach, this article strives to contribute to the ongoing discussions on the epistemological shifts in social media big data (SM BD) studies. This study offers an insight into the development of analytical methods and research practices in SM BD studies during their rapid growth period in 2012- 2016. The study findings only partially revealed the 'end of theory' claim: The problem setting of the studies is rather weakly related to theory, often neither hypothesis nor research questions are formulated on the basis of previous theories or research. However, this relatively weak relatedness to theory has not led to the descriptive type of inference, but rather exploratory, or predictive ways of reasoning. Instead of enabling predictions in social science research, SM BD raises issues of understanding the causes and effects in predictions for evaluating the social mechanisms of global disruptions. Developing 'human research machines' that exploit the cognitive resources of individuals should not be the aim of SM BD production. The outcome should be to recognise that the cognitive abilities of researchers, access to data, and developing novel methods are necessary for evaluating the global impact of social behaviour. © 2020 Estonian Association for the History and Philosophy of Science.

As a result, factors predicting happiness have been employed by researchers and scholars in various studies on Muslim women. Thus, this study examined and found out the factors predicting happiness such as culture, socio-economic status (SES) and religious coping as well as identified the foremost and majorpredictor and research design used by these scholars. A systematic review of the literature on culture, socio-economic status and religious coping as predictors of happiness among Muslim women was carried out. A total of number of 30 articles from different disciplines has been examined. The factors and research design found were divided in to those that belong to happiness predicted by culture, by socio-economic status, by religious coping and by culture, socio-economic status and religious coping, happiness related to culture, happiness related to culture, to socio-economic status, to religious coping and related to culture, socio-economic status and religious coping. The research designs were quantitative, qualitative, mixed method and systematic literature review (SLR). Quantitative research design was found to be the leading research design.The studies were also examined based on countries of study; Iran, Turkey, Palestine, Oman, Qatar, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh, Algeria, Jordan, Indonesia, Malaysia and Lebanon. Iran was the leading country. But no model of happiness was found in the studies analysed.

Urban freight transport plays a critical role in the promotion of sustainable and livable cities. According to the literature review, considerable research on SUFT has focused on resolving some specific problems with a short-term perspective. The existence of an urban freight transport strategy is noted, which should be embedded in an overall sustainable development strategy with a long-term perspective (approximately 20-30 years). Nevertheless, considerable research has paid scant attention to the long-term planning of SUFT. Given this, this paper contributes to the closure of this gap. First, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to highlight published papers involving foresight research within the past 16 years (2003-2018). This step contributes to the understanding of research methods that can be used in foresight research. Subsequently, this paper discusses the impacts of both urban development and distribution innovations on future SUFT, and these effects are used to select the appropriate methods to construct the theoretical research framework. Finally, the theoretical research framework of long-term planning for SUFT is developed on the basis of two future perspectives: the trends of urban development and the application of urban distribution innovations. This framework is intended to provide an approach to designing sustainable urban logistics, taking into account urban development and distribution innovations. © 2020 by the authors.","Distribution innovations; Foresight research; Future perspective; Sustainability; Sustainable city logistics; Sustainable urban freight transport; Theoretical research framework; Urban development","freight transport; future prospect; innovation; literature review; research work; smart city; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; urban development; urban transport","He, Z.; Chair of Maritime Business and Logistics, University of BremenGermany; email: zhe@uni-bremen.de",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082678696

Over the years, anti-RibP autoantibodies have been the subject of extensive study and became known as a highly specific biomarker for the diagnosis of SLE and were associated with neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), lupus nephritis (LN) and hepatitis (LH). As demonstrated by studies on cultured human cells and of murine models, there is evidence to suggest that anti-RibP may have a pathogenic role in LN and NPSLE. Despite a wealth of evidence, in comparison to other SLE autoantibodies such as anti-Sm and anti-dsDNA, anti-RibP has not been included in classification criteria for SLE. A significant challenge is the variability of assays used to detect anti-RibP, including the antigens and diagnostic platforms employed. This may account for the marked variation in frequencies (10–47%) in SLE and its association with clinical and demographic features reported in SLE cohorts. We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to help clarify its prevalence, various clinical and serological associations in SLE based on the different RibP antigens and assay platforms used. © 2020 The Author(s)",,"antibody; autoantibody; p autoantibody; ribosomal p antibody; unclassified drug; autoantibody; ribosome protein; central nervous system; central nervous system depression; disease activity; hepatitis; human; lupus erythematosus nephritis; meta analysis; psychosis; Review; sensitivity and specificity; seroprevalence; SLEDAI; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; animal; brain vasculitis; immunology; mouse; systemic lupus erythematosus; Animals; Autoantibodies; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Lupus Nephritis; Lupus Vasculitis, Central Nervous System; Mice; Ribosomal Proteins","Fritzler, M.J.; Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, 3330 Hospital Dr. NW, Canada; email: fritzler@ucalgary.ca",,"Elsevier B.V.",15689972,,ARUEB,"31927088","English","Autoimmun.

The execution of agile practices in Global Software Development (GSD) is more complex than collocated environment (single site development). The objectives of this study is to explore the factors which positively and negatively impact on scaling program of agile development in the GSD context and propose a framework based on the factors for successful scaling of agile programs in GSD context. This study is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol was adopted to investigate the factors. In the second stage, the SWOT analytical framework was followed to classify the factors into four categories: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. In the SWOT framework, the factors in strengths and weaknesses categories represent the internal aspects of the organizations while the opportunities and threats categories indicate the external aspects of organization. The findings of this study reported 24 factors. The identified 13 factors positively and 11 factors negatively impact on scaling program of agile development respectively. Moreover, a framework based on SWOT analysis is proposed that provided the classification of factors into four categories. Based on the research outcomes, we can conclude that the identified factors and their classification intoSWOT categories provide a robust framework that will assist the agile practitioners for successfully scale agile development in the GSD organizations. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Agile development; Global software development; Scaling; SWOT","Computer applications; Computer programming; Agile development; Distributed environments; Global software development; Project development; Scaling; Software organization; SWOT; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450375948,,,"English","ACM Int.

The SDN efforts are provided to abstract the original network configuration for business applications and web services. Additionally, the SDN modifies the network management policies such as topology policies, deployment policies, the applicability, and infrastructure maintenance. One of the important features of the SDN is standardizing the network interfaces with the precise functional semantics in application and control flow layers. In another hand, specification and evaluation of the existing network interfaces is a main and significant challenge to prove the correctness of the configurable scenarios in the SDN approach. Recently, formal verification presents a high potential platform to evaluate the main-layer scenarios of the SDN as the novel perspective in this area. Up to now, there is no survey and state-of-the-art review on the formal verification methods in the SDN. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) for the formal verification methods in the SDN in form of the SDN plans to recognize the state of the art of the open challenges.

We therefore conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to collect and categorize maintainability assurance approaches for service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices. Our search strategy led to the selection of 223 primary studies from 2007 to 2018 which we categorized with a threefold taxonomy: a) architectural (SOA, microservices, both), b) methodical (method or contribution of the study), and c) thematic (maintainability assurance subfield). We discuss the distribution among these categories and present different research directions as well as exemplary studies per thematic category.

Timely, high quality postnatal care is crucial for maximizing maternal and newborn health. In this vein, the use of postnatal mobile applications constitutes a promising strategy. Methods: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol was adopted to perform the selection, data extraction and functional evaluation of the available postnatal apps on iOS and Android platforms. The analysis of the functionalities and technical features of the apps selected was performed according to a 37-items assessment questionnaire developed on the basis of the scientific literature of postnatal care and a preliminary analysis of available postnatal apps Results: A total of 48 postnatal apps were retrieved from the app repositories of the iOS and Android platforms. The results of the functional content analysis show that the postnatal apps selected relatively achieved low scores owing to the complexity and the ramification of the postnatal care. Conclusions: The present study helps in identifying areas related to the postnatal care that require further endeavors to be properly addressed.

The relationships among community stakeholders along with their responsibilities and actions are important social capitals coping with community disaster, which have a significant impact on forming the community resilience. Accordingly, this paper is the first attempt to measure the community resilience using social network analysis (SNA) method from the view of social capitals of stakeholders. Firstly, six key disaster-adapting social capitals in the urban community are identified using systematic literature review (SLR). Then, the social capitals before, during and after the community disaster are calculated based on the SNA to characterize the level of community resilience. Finally, taking a waterlogging disaster in Nanjing city of China, some implements on enhancing the community resilience in different phases are proposed from four aspects: rapidity, robustness, redundancy and resourcefulness. The findings in the case study and the conclusions of this paper provides an easy method to calculate the resilience and social capitals of a community at different stages of a disaster, and also helps to improve disaster prevention and reduction efforts in urban communities, especially those that are collaboratively managed by multi-stakeholders. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Disaster; Resilience; Social capital; Social network analysis; Stakeholders; Urban community","Disasters; Social networking (online); Community resiliences; Disaster management; Multi-stakeholder; Resilience; Social capitals; Stakeholders; Systematic literature review (SLR); Urban community; Disaster prevention","Li, D.; Southeast University - Jiulonghu Campus, Jiangning District, China; email: njldz@seu.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074372426

Systematic identification of the burden of β-thalassemia with contemporary treatments is lacking in published literature. Thus, a gap exists in understanding the baseline burden on which to assess future treatments. Therefore, a systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to assess management and outcomes in patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia (TDT) who received long-term transfusion regimens. Methods: Searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 5 conference websites were conducted to identify clinical-practice studies in Italy, France, Germany, Greece, the United States, and the United Kingdom, published since January 2007. The review found 135 articles meeting the SLR criteria. Findings: Among patients carrying 2 β-thalassemia mutations, 64%–89% underwent regular transfusions at intervals of between 2 and 4 weeks. Transfusion-associated complications that were reported included iron overload, transfusion reactions, alloimmunization, and infections. Analyses of 42, 25, and 73 studies reporting liver iron concentration (median, 8.5 mg/g of dry weight [dw]; interquartile range [IQR], 4.5–11.0 mg/g dw), cardiac T2* magnetic resonance imaging (median, 27.4 ms; IQR, 26.0–30.2 ms), and serum ferritin (median, 1465.0 ng/mL; IQR, 1238.2–1797.0 ng/mL), respectively, showed wide ranges in iron levels and a general trend toward improved iron control in recent years. Adverse transfusion reactions and alloimmunization were reported in ~50% and 10%–20% in patients, respectively. Rates of transfusion-transmitted infections were highly variable by study but were lower in more recent cohorts. Complications stemming from iron overload and underlying disease captured in this SLR included cardiac disease, liver disease, and endocrine and musculoskeletal disorders. Approximately 10% of patients were diagnosed with heart failure, with rates ranging from 2.9% to 20.9% across 6 studies. Other significant complications reported with β-thalassemia included pain (25%–69%), psychiatric disorders (25%–30%), and reduced health-related quality of life. Despite substantial improvements in survival, patients with TDT remained at an increased risk for early mortality. Implications: Consistent with improvements in transfusion practices and iron monitoring and management, outcomes in patients with TDT have improved. However, iron overload and disease-associated complications remain a challenge in this population. This review supports the burden of disease affecting patients with β-thalassemia and provides a baseline health status against which to assess future improvements in care © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Blood transfusion; Iron chelation; Iron overload; Systematic literature review; β-Thalassemia","ferritin; hemoglobin; alloimmunization; beta thalassemia; bibliographic database; blood transfusion; blood transfusion reaction; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical practice; disease burden; endocrine disease; ferritin blood level; heart failure; human; infection; iron chelation; iron overload; liver disease; mental disease; meta analysis; morbidity; mortality; musculoskeletal disease; patient monitoring; quality of life; Review; survival; systematic review; transfusion; transfusion dependent beta thalassemia","Betts, M.; Evidence Synthesis, Modeling, and Communication, Evidera, 500 Totten Pond Road, 5th Floor, United States; email: marissa.betts@evidera.com",,"Excerpta Medica Inc.",01492918,,CLTHD,"31882227","English","Clin.

Recent data show rates of spontaneous thelarche (ST) of 38% and spontaneous menarche (SM) of 15-16%, with higher rates in those with mosaicism. Summary: We systematically reviewed the literature for evidence regarding rates of ST and SM in TS and evaluated rates based on the type of chromosomal mosaicism. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials. Reference lists were screened. Studies reporting outcomes of ST and SM in girls with TS, diagnosed by genetic analysis, were included. Data was collected regarding study design, cohort type, cohort age, the number of participants with ST and SM, the individual age at diagnosis of ST and SM, the mean age of patients with ST and SM, sample size, the number of participants with secondary amenorrhea, and karyotype. Key Messages: In total 2,699 patients were assessed for ST and 2,890 for SM from 43 articles. Overall the rates of ST were 32% (95% CI 26.4-38.9) and SM 20.8% (95% CI 19.3-22.4). Girls with X monosomy had the lowest rates of ST (i.e., 13%; 95% CI 8.7-19.7) and SM (i.e., 9.1%; 95% CI 7.3-11.3). Girls with 45,X/47,XXX had the highest rates of ST (i.e., 88.1%; 95% CI 62-97.1) and SM (i.e., 66.2%; 95% CI 49.3-79.6). Conclusions: Rates of ST and SM differ by karyotype in TS. When counseling patients, the karyotype should strongly influence discussions regarding pubertal development and the future reproductive potential. © 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Methods: A review of the published SM literature was carried out through a Medline search up to December 2018. The search using the keyword “spinal meningiomas” returned 248 papers and the parameters analyzed in our present study were examined in those publications. Papers without a detailed description of clinical findings, neuroimaging confirmation of the spinal tumor, minimum follow-up of 5 years, or a clear description of the clinical findings were excluded. Results: In the 24 manuscripts reviewed, 1811 (1450 females/361 males) patients with SM were analyzed. The thoracic spine (1181–64.6%) and cervical spine (394–22.7%) were the more prevalent levels. The psammomatous (27.8%) and meningothelial variants (25.2%) were the most prevalent histopathological subtypes. Gross total resection (Simpson I and II) was achieved in 94.5% of cases and subtotal resection (Simpson III or more) in 5.5%. The tumor recurrence rate was 4.4%, and the mortality rate related to surgery or disease progression was 3%. Conclusion: WHO grade I predominance was observed among spinal meningiomas, analogous to intracranial meningiomas. SMs predominated in the thoracic spine. Surgery with gross total resection was achieved in the vast majority of cases, resulting in low recurrence and mortality rates. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS","Mortality; Recurrence; Spinal meningioma; Surgical modality","cervical spine; histopathology; human; meningioma; mortality rate; neuroimaging; Review; spinal meningioma; spine tumor; surgical approach; systematic review; thoracic spine; tumor recurrence","Jamilson Araújo Pereira, B.; Departamento de Neurologia da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Rua Martiniano de Carvalho, 669, Edifício Paulista Paradise Life, Apto 1105, Brazil; email: benedito.jamilson@hotmail.com",,"Elsevier Masson SAS",00283770,,NUREB,"31672597","English; French","Neurochirurgie",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077698841

CM is a support process that helps organizations have better management of their infrastructure. Its importance, in the Information Technology (IT) domain, has increased in recent years, despite this process not being technologically new, and the fact that many organizations implement this process in a haphazard way, which results in it not producing the benefits that it should produce. With the intention of assessing and improving the organizations' IT processes practices and capabilities, MMs have been developed and implemented. However, the application of MM in the CM domain is yet to be explored. Design/Methodology/Approach: Two Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) and a Critical Analysis were performed. In sum, 80 scientific articles of the most rated conferences and scientific journals were analyzed and conclusions were drawn. Results: This research concludes that despite the CM process being badly implemented, using a MM this process could decrease operational costs and increase the quality management of the infrastructure. Conclusion: However, no MM has been developed so far for the CM process practices. This MM would be a viable support tool for the IT organizations providers since this would help organizations have a mature CM process and better control of their IT infrastructure. Therefore, the existence of a MM for the CM domain would be a welcome advancement that should be developed in the future. © 2020 João P.

However, depending on the intended use, concrete’s embedded materials’ quantities can change significantly, affecting its environmental performance. Seldom investigated, sprayed concrete’s impact differs from that of typical ready mixed concrete, which justifies a differentiated inspection. Our goals are (i) to prove that sprayed concrete’s environmental impacts are under-investigated and (ii) to provide an overview on how concrete’s components’ production cycles are typically modelled in LCAs. Methods: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to gather the widest possible sample of papers in a replicable and transparent manner, aiming to answer two research questions: ‘What is the life cycle performance of sprayed concrete?’ and ‘What are the most frequent methodological choices made to perform an LCA of concrete’s constituents?’. We used eight different keyword strings for each of concrete’s most used components and searched for documents in databases Springer and ScienceDirect. After 3 conservative filtering rounds, 282 papers were thoroughly and collectively assessed to feed the outcome herein documented. Results and discussion: The investigated literature not only showed a gap in sprayed concrete’s environmental impacts documentation but also allowed us to build a literary dossier to ground researches aiming to calculate typical concrete mixes’ impact through LCA, assuring comparability with the ecological status quo for that construction material. Practitioners’ most frequent methodological choices were documented, along with common standard breaches and limitations in investigated studies. Conclusions: By systematically structuring our research protocol, we covered enough papers to provide a sound overview and to make collective conclusions regarding available literature. We make two main recommendations for LCA practitioners: non-carbon correlated impact categories ought to be investigated—especially as we move towards more carbon-friendly technologies in concrete/cement manufacturing. Second, practitioners should always comply with the transparency requirements of an LCA. Our outcome pointed to an alarming number of published papers that failed to declare basic methodological choices such as data sources, assessment methods used and impact distribution strategies in multifunctional processes’ modelling. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cement; Concrete; LCA; Life cycle assessment; Sprayed concrete; Systematic literature review","cement; concrete; limestone; plasticizer; sprayed concrete; unclassified drug; built environment; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental impact; eutrophication; fly ash; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; priority journal; recycling; Review; sand; slag; systematic review","Passer, A.; Institute of Technology and Testing of Building Materials, Graz University of TechnologyAustria; email: alexander.passer@tugraz.at",,"Springer",09483349,,IJLCF,,"English","Int.

An interesting research avenue is how firms explore the process of the new product development (NPD) and the ideas generation to foster resource-constrained innovation. However, despite the importance of product development and creative ideas under the resource-constraints contexts, innovation methods for applying to the resource-constrained innovation and designers have received comparatively less attention. As a remedy, this paper proposes a resource-constrained innovation method (RCIM) to generate ideas for the NPD. The RCIM is mainly divided into four sections: Developing the resource-constrained innovation approaches, developing the resource-constrained innovation dimensions, generating the creative ideas and evaluating the creative ideas. First, the resource-constrained innovation algorithms are developed based on success factors, characteristics, and attributes of resource-constrained innovation and the TRIZ (TeopeyPeoeiey Ecoapeoaoeeuceex Caaa÷in Russian; Theory of Inventive Problem Solving in English) inventive principles via the systematic literature review (SLR). Second, the innovation dimensions are categorized to structure a target technology by means of the morphological analysis (MA) and the Derwent manual codes (DMCs) mapping based on collected patents. Third, the creative ideas are generated for the NPD by combining the innovation dimensions with the resource-constrained innovation approaches. Finally, the creative ideas are evaluated by the frugal criteria. The RCIM will stimulate designers' creativity for achieving sustainability and innovation within constraint-based scenarios, MA and TRIZ. © 2020 by the authors.","Innovation approaches; Innovation dimensions; Innovation method; Morphological analysis; Resource-constrained innovation; Sustainability; TRIZ","algorithm; innovation; literature review; resource use; sustainability","Liu, Z.; School of Economics and Management, Shanghai Maritime UniversityChina; email: zfliu@shmtu.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081252042

Yet, the discrepancies in the results of accompanying studies warrant an updated and systematic consolidation of all available evidence. We report a systematic review of studies testing whether text/image messages, interactive voice response reminders, or calls promote adherence and retention to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in LMICs. We systematically compiled studies published in English until June 2018 from PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, WHO database, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and manual search. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2009 and used frequency analysis to assess reported findings. In total, we compiled 35 published articles: 27 completed studies and 8 protocols. Among the main 27 studies, 17 examine adherence, 5 retention, and 5 both measures. Results indicate that 56% report positive and statistically significantly impacts of mHealth on primary outcomes, the remaining 44% report insignificant results. While 41% of studies found a positive and significant effect for adherence, only 12% improved retention. The evidence shows ambiguous results (with high variability) about the effectiveness of mobile phone-assisted mHealth interventions to boost adherence and retention to ART. The literature also points to short follow-up periods, small samples, and limited geographical coverage. Hence, future research should focus on evaluating longer interventions with more patients spread across wider areas to address whether mHealth can be effectively used in LMICs. © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.","antiretroviral treatment; HIV/AIDS patient care; low- and middle-income countries; mobile health technology (mHealth); short message service","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; antiretrovirus agent; antiretroviral therapy; Article; cell phone use; follow up; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; low income country; medication compliance; middle income country; patient compliance; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; virus load; developing country; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; mobile phone; psychology; telemedicine; text messaging; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Cell Phone; Developing Countries; HIV Infections; Humans; Medication Adherence; Retention in Care; Telemedicine; Text Messaging","Wagner, N.; Institute of Social Studies, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Kortenaerkade 12, Netherlands; email: wagner@iss.nl",,"Mary Ann Liebert Inc.",10872914,,APCSF,"32049555","English","AIDS Patient Care STDs",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079339333

In the context of the World Health Organization's End TB strategy and the quest for digital innovations, there is a need to understand what is happening around the world regarding research into the use of digital technology for better TB care and control. Objective: The purpose of this scoping review was to summarize the state of research on the use of digital technology to enhance TB care and control. This study provides an overview of publications covering this subject and answers 3 main questions: (1) to what extent has the issue been addressed in the scientific literature between January 2016 and March 2019, (2) which countries have been investing in research in this field, and (3) what digital technologies were used? Methods: A Web-based search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Science. Studies that describe the use of digital technology with specific reference to keywords such as TB, digital health, eHealth, and mHealth were included. Data from selected studies were synthesized into 4 functions using narrative and graphical methods. Such digital health interventions were categorized based on 2 classifications, one by function and the other by targeted user. Results: A total of 145 relevant studies were identified out of the 1005 published between January 2016 and March 2019. Overall, 72.4% (105/145) of the research focused on patient care and 20.7% (30/145) on surveillance and monitoring. Other programmatic functions 4.8% (7/145) and electronic learning 2.1% (3/145) were less frequently studied. Most digital health technologies used for patient care included primarily diagnostic 59.4% (63/106) and treatment adherence tools 40.6% (43/106). On the basis of the second type of classification, 107 studies targeted health care providers (107/145, 73.8%), 20 studies targeted clients (20/145, 13.8%), 17 dealt with data services (17/145, 11.7%), and 1 study was on the health system or resource management. The first authors' affiliations were mainly from 3 countries: the United States (30/145 studies, 20.7%), China (20/145 studies, 13.8%), and India (17/145 studies, 11.7%). The researchers from the United States conducted their research both domestically and abroad, whereas researchers from China and India conducted all studies domestically. Conclusions: The majority of research conducted between January 2016 and March 2019 on digital interventions for TB focused on diagnostic tools and treatment adherence technologies, such as video-observed therapy and SMS. Only a few studies addressed interventions for data services and health system or resource management. © 2020 Yejin Lee, Mario C Raviglione, Antoine Flahault.","EHealth; Medical informatics; MHealth; Tuberculosis","adult; China; diagnosis; e-learning; female; health care personnel; human; India; male; medical informatics; Medline; narrative; patient care; resource management; review; scientific literature; systematic review; telehealth; tuberculosis control; United States; videorecording; Web of Science; learning","Lee, Y.; Institute of Global Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, 9 Chemin des Mines, Switzerland; email: Ye-Jin.Lee@etu.unige.ch",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,"32053111","English","J.

With the advent of consumer-grade electroencephalography (EEG) devices, brain-controlled systems started to find applications outside of the medical field, opening many research opportunities in the area of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). One particular area that is gaining more evidence due to the arrival of consumer-grade devices is that of computer games, as it allows more user-friendly applications of BCI technology for the general public. In this paper, the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of BCI games using consumer-grade devices are presented. Papers published in a time span of 12 years were reviewed and their data collected using a rigid systematic process. Several analyses were made based on the gathered data, and a clear view of the current scenario and challenges for HCI of BCI-based games using consumer-grade devices is provided. The search shows that although many games were created with simplified controls for research purposes, there was an increasing number of more user-friendly BCI games, especially for entertainment. The most predominant control signals were the attention and meditation, followed by motor imagery and emotion recognition, being mainly captured by NeuroSky and Emotiv EEG devices. The results also show that there are still many open issues and research opportunities in the field of HCI for BCI-based games, as most evaluations investigated only quantitative aspects of the BCI systems, while very few studies analyzed usability and qualitative aspects of the users’ interaction with the games. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Computer control systems; Computer games; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Human computer interaction; Emotion recognition; Human computer interaction (HCI); Predominant control; Qualitative aspects; Research opportunities; Specialized systems; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Brain computer interface","Vasiljevic, G.A.M.; Department of Informatics and Applied Mathematics, Federal University of Rio, Grande do Norte (UFRN), Av.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken. Four databases were included in the structured searches (EBSCOhost, Web of Knowledge, Scopus, ProQuest and Emerald Insight), 19 studies were finally included and analysed in detail. Findings: The results obtained identify issues such as a growing trend in the publication of studies, the dominant position of the USA and the predominance of empirical papers. The literature was classified according to whether it presents CI as a DC in itself, as an enabler of DC or as a result of the DC. The main critical success factors to be implemented in CI initiatives (CII) were also identified, to enhance the development of DCs. Finally, based on the analysis of the specific DC literature, ten theoretical propositions for possible future research have been developed. Originality/value: CII such as Lean Management, Six Sigma and Total Quality Management have been widely implemented in organisations. Despite their reputation, the effects of these initiatives on long-term benefits remain debated, this motivates the SLR of CII and DC. The DC theory tackles the question of how firms can sustain their advantage and profits in the long term, making this perspective ideal for tackling controversy on the benefits of CII. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Continuous improvement; Dynamic capability; Lean; Six sigma; Systematic literature review; Total quality management",,"Antony, J.; Department of Business Management, Heriot-Watt UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: J.Antony@hw.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20404166,,,,"English","Int.

Integrated statistical activities require a process of statistical activities that does not silo thinking. This silo thinking can be detrimental to BPS-Statistics Indonesia, especially in terms of overcoming the problem of statistical activities that have actually occurred in previous statistical activities. From these problems it is necessary to identify important knowledge that is useful to be able to be accessed and used as a lesson learned by other statistical activities. In Knowledge Management there is a tool to help identify important knowledge, namely Knowledge Map, which is assisted by analysis using the Social Network Analysis (SNA) technique. To solve the problem, BPS-Statistics Indonesia needs to conduct a study on the application of this knowledge maps with SNA technique. In this study, a study literature on knowledge maps with SNA was carried out. This literature study is in the form of Systematic Literature Review (SLR). From this literature study, an overview of the fields used as research subjects on knowledge maps with SNA, description of objectives and research suggestions currently used by researchers.

The purpose of this paper is to map and categorise the studies developed on the Arapaima gigas, a commercialisable fish native to the Amazon, responding to the following research questions: first, which links of the production chain have most of the studies on the pisciculture of the Amazon region? Second, is environmental performance being approached in studies on production chains in the Amazon region? To reach the objective, the authors used the systematic literature review (SLR) method. The authors analysed a sample of 121 articles published in 95 journals between 1981 and 2018. The research contains bibliometric and contents analyses. The main conclusions include the identification of various possibilities of studies throughout the different production chains in the Amazon region; the multidisciplinarity of research on a single species in the Amazon region; the importance of empirical studies in the construction of knowledge about the natural behaviour of the species; the need for integration and sharing of knowledge to create an efficient and competitive production chain. As a limitation, this study encompasses a broad spectrum of issues in the literature, therefore, it was only possible to offer a general overview of these issues. At the same time, this broad and intentional approach presents a comprehensive framing of the themes and phenomena that occur at each link of the production chain of Amazon fish farming. Design/methodology/approach: This research consists in an SLR with organised, transparent and replicable procedures as recommended in the literature (Littell et al., 2008). The SLR is suited to the mapping of areas where there is a high level of uncertainty and new studies are necessary (Petticrew and Roberts, 2006). This research method is especially useful when dealing with a large volume of information (Tranfield et al., 2003). The use of SLR limits researcher bias by trying to evaluate and select relevant studies on the study theme (Petticrew and Roberts, 2006). Findings: There are a number of possibilities for studies of the different production chains in the Amazon region; the results of mapping the production chains help to prioritise “what” should be researched in the Amazon region to promote more effective impacts for all stakeholders; research on pisciculture in the Amazon region can be used as a diagnostic tool for public policy formulators; the development of corporate environmental management is intrinsically linked to the process of analysis and understanding of the operations and costs that arise in different links of the production chain. Research limitations/implications: As a limitation, this study encompasses a broad spectrum of issues in the literature, therefore, it was only possible to offer a general overview of these issues. Practical implications: In terms of practical implications, it is possible to note that the dispersion of themes found in this study confirms the plurality of the richness of the Amazon and suggests that research institutions should be able to commit to the drafting of integrated planning of science, as well as compilation of the results reached. It is also important to highlight Brazil’s role in the leadership of research in the Amazon region compared to other countries. Originality/value: The aim of the paper was twofold: to supply a focussed review of the literature on the production chain of a species in Amazon pisciculture and to identify a research agenda capable of overcoming the gaps that impede the development of this chain. More specifically, this study reviewed the available research on the chain in question to analyse the links that have the largest volume of studies and to orient future research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Amazon region; Arapaima gigas; Pirarucu; Production chain; Systematic literature review","commercial species; environmental planning; fish; future prospect; literature review; native species; research; Amazonia; Animalia; Arapaima gigas","Ferreira, G.; University of São PauloBrazil; email: gleriani@usp.br",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14777835,,,,"English","Manage.

The identified 133 journals had provided study details on the information accuracy practices in the tourism environment. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges in dealing with tourism information have been explained as well. The SLR findings had revealed that the existing research on information accuracy in the tourism context was not sufficiently practiced by the tourism information providers and that there was still room for improvement. The existing information accuracy practices in tourism covers a minimal number of topics and very few closely related studies were available for this review. The SLR findings were twofold. On the one hand, tourism information providers should embrace the many opportunities that tourism information can offer to improve information accuracy practices.

However, systematic literature reviews are still scarce in the project management literature. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to conduct a systematic literature review on project manager's leadership competencies based on published empirical research studies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employed a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to synthesize research in a rigorous manner and a total of 1,780 articles were identified in the first step and a final sample of 60 research studies were synthesized. Findings: Synthesis of the findings in this SLR on project manager's leadership competencies revealed: (a) there is a lack of categorization or ranking of leadership competencies; (b) 20 research studies (46%) were conducted with sample sizes of less than 100; (c) only a few research studies (<10%) used interview data for analysis; and (d) none of the research studies reported adoption of a triangulation method. Research limitations/implications: This study synthesized clusters of leadership competencies and prioritized project manager's leadership competencies as “high priority”, “moderate priority” and “low priority”. We recommend a sample size between 200 and 300 to produce sophisticated results and enhance the credibility, generalizability and validity of clusters and priorities of project manager's leadership competencies through future research. Originality/value: Future research studies are suggested to consider systematic literature review combined with face-to-face and group interview in addition to employing triangulation methods. Besides highlighting implications for practitioners, this SLR has advanced the understanding of how to conduct systematic literature reviews in a robust manner. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Leadership; Leadership competencies; Project manager; Systematic literature review","Project management; Sampling; Triangulation; Design/methodology/approach; Empirical research; Low priorities; Project managers; Research studies; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Triangulation method; Managers","Ahmed, R.; Department of Management Studies, Bahria UniversityPakistan; email: riazutm@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09699988,,,,"English","Eng.

The evaluation and filtering phase of prevalent SLR methodologies is therefore time consuming and hardly expressible to the intended audience. The proposed method applies natural language processing (NLP) on article meta data and a k-means clustering algorithm to automatically convert large article corpora into a distribution of focal topics. This allows efficient filtering as well as objectifying the process through the discussion of the clustering results. Beyond that, it allows to quickly identify scientific communities and therefore provides an iterative perspective for the so far linear SLR methodology. • NLP and k-means clustering to filter large article corpora during systematic literature reviews. • Automated clustering allows filtering very efficiently as well as effectively compared to manual selection. • Presentation and discussion of the clustering results helps to objectify the nontransparent filtering step in systematic literature reviews. © 2020","Clustering; Literature filtering; Systematic literature review; Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","Article; artificial intelligence; comparative study; data aggregation; dimensionality reduction; hierarchical clustering; k means clustering; machine learning; Medline; metadata; natural language processing; priority journal; search engine; semantics; singular value decomposition; systematic review (topic)","Weißer, T.; Chair for International Production Engineering and Management, University of Siegenemail: tim.weisser@uni-siegen.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",22150161,,,,"English","MethodsX",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081547594

It provides needed living support and convenience for elderly people in society. Despite the remarkable achievements in smart home monitoring technology studies, a systematic literature review (SLR) on smart home technology implementation is lacking. There is a limited number of SLR studies on smart home monitoring technology. Therefore, the current study assesses the literature to collect the evidence regarding studies on smart home monitoring technology implantation. An SLR method involving a manual search was applied to review the articles published from January 2010 to December 2019. To carefully classify these articles accordingly, we applied certain quality assessment criteria. Out of 73 relevant primary studies, only 3% were identified to have applied comprehensive SLR guidelines. Seven percent of the relevant studies were identified to have applied the SLR guidelines in a strongly moderately acceptable manner, but they were not completely comprehensive, whereas 8% of the primary studies applied the SLR guideline in a fairly acceptable manner. This manuscript therefore encourages researchers working on SLR studies on smart home technology to apply comprehensive SLR guidelines that takes into account the quality standard. © 2013 IEEE.","elderly people; Internet of Things; monitoring technologies; smart home technology; systematic literature review","Automation; Intelligent buildings; Quality management; Elderly people; Internet of Things (IOT); Quality assessment; Quality standard; Smart Home Technology; Smart homes; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Internet of things","Ghani, N.B.A.; Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of MalayaMalaysia; email: norjihan@um.edu.my",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085640861

SLR is a process that allowed to collect relevant evidence on the given topic that fits the pre-specified eligibility criteria and to have an answer for the formulated research questions. Meta-analysis needs the use of statistical methods that can be descriptive and/or inferential to summarizing data from several studies on the specific topic of interest. The techniques help to generate knowledge from multiple studies both in qualitative and quantitative ways. The usual method has four basic steps: search (define searching string and types of databases), appraisal (pre-defined literature inclusion and exclusion, and quality assessment criteria), synthesis (extract and categorized the data), and analysis (narrate the result and finally reach into conclusion) (SALSA). However, this work added two steps which are research protocol (define the research scope) and reporting results (stating the procedure followed and communicating the result to the public) at the initial and last step, respectively. As a result, the new method has six basic steps which are abbreviated as PSALSAR. Therefore, this method is applicable to assess the existing knowledge, trends, and gaps in ecosystem services. In sum, this literature review method presents: • The PSALSAR method is an explicit, transferable and reproducible procedure to conduct systematic review work. • It helps to assess both quantitative and qualitative content analysis of the literature review. • The procedure listed here added two basic steps (protocol and reporting result) on a commonly known SALSA framework. © 2019 The Authors","Ecosystem services; Environmental science; Meta-analysis; Method for systematic literature review and meta-analysis studies; PICOC; PRISMA; PSALSAR; SALSA; Systematic literature review","Article; ecosystem; environmental health; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality control; quantitative analysis; research","Mengist, W.; Department of Natural Resource Management, Debre-Berhan UniversityEthiopia; email: wondie21emu@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",22150161,,,,"English","MethodsX",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077981481

Nonetheless, no Systematic Literature Review (SLR), and even no literature survey, aimed at analyzing the current state of academic and industrial research knowledge on recommender systems for the offline retailing domain is reported in the literature. There is, therefore, a need for conducting a SLR that allows revealing the trends and challenges in the research and development of recommender systems for that domain. In this chapter, we present the details about the planning, execution and analysis of results of a SLR of the state of the art of recommender systems for the offline retailing domain. The findings of the analysis of results shed light, among other things, on the necessity of further research on recommendation systems and algorithms for the offline retailing domain, specially, for small local stores and chain stores in the categories of department stores, drugstores and convenience stores. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Offline retailer; Recommendation algorithm; Recommender system; Systematic literature review",,"Colombo-Mendoza, L.O.; Tecnológico Nacional de México/I.

A bibliometric analysis was conducted to investigate the maturity of this research area and identify opportunities for development. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to provide a comprehensive and rigorous review of the existing literature. The search was conducted on 10 platforms identifying 97 publications, which were evaluated using bibliometric analysis. Findings: The analysis revealed that applications of SD are most commonly used in the PM system design phase to model organisational performance. In addition, the bibliometric results showed a highly dispersed author set, with most studies using exploratory methods, suggesting that the research is in a relatively early stage of development. The results also showed that over 50 per cent of the causal models were not validated, emphasizing an important methodological gap in this research area. Research limitations/implications: This SLR is limited to indexed publications on 10 platforms, the search strategy was relatively precise and only available papers in English language were used for the literature review. Practical implications: PM systems supported by SD can help managers understand and improve organisational behaviours by addressing dynamic complexities and relationship between variables. This study evaluates the maturity of this research area including information about the current development of this area and opportunities to build on existing knowledge. Originality/value: This study identifies how SD approaches are applied to PM and highlights areas that require further research consideration.

For computer science, several threats to the completeness of such reviews have been identified, leading to recommendations and guidelines on how to improve their quality. However, few studies address to what extent researchers can replicate an SLR. To conduct a replication, researchers have to first understand how the set of primary studies has been identified in the original study, and can ideally retrieve the same set when following the reported protocol. In this article, we focus on this initial step of a replication and report a two-fold empirical study: Initially, we performed a tertiary study using a sample of SLRs in computer science and identified what information that is needed to replicate the searches is reported. Based on the results, we conducted a descriptive, multi-case study on digital libraries to investigate to what extent these allow replications. The results reveal two threats to replications of SLRs: First, while researchers have improved the quality of their reports, relevant details are still missing—we refer to a reporting threat. Second, we found that some digital libraries are inconsistent in their query results—we refer to a searching threat. While researchers conducting a review can only overcome the first threat and the second may not be an issue for all kinds of replications, researchers should be aware of both threats when conducting, reviewing, and building on SLRs. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Digital library; Replication; Software engineering; Systematic literature review; Tertiary study; Threats to validity","Software engineering; Empirical method; Empirical studies; Replication; Still missing; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Tertiary study; Threats to validity; Digital libraries","Krüger, J.; Harz University of Applied SciencesGermany; email: jkrueger@ovgu.de",,"Springer",13823256,,ESENF,,"English","Empir Software Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072114420

POME is a highly polluting effluent that demands appropriate handling before it can be disposed to the water bodies. POME treatment is a significant concern in palm oil mills and the treatment technique has fascinated several researchers related with environmental pollution. Numerous conventional treatment approaches are unsuccessful to accomplish the standard needed to reduce the pollutants in the POME to allowable levels. Several advanced treatment technologies have developed with high productivity to lessen the contaminants levels. However, the incorporation of conventional treatment with advanced technologies is a feasible tactic for POME treatment. Therefore, in the current review, systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to organize the scattered available information and provides insight on the various treatment methods of POME. From the SLR, it is evident that advanced oxidation process, membrane bioreactors, and adsorption is a feasible way, hence, resolving the environmental issues of waste disposal and pollution arising from the palm oil industry. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adsorption; electrocoagulation; Fenton oxidation; membrane bioreactor; photocatalysis; POME; ultrasonication","Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Effluents; Petroleum industry; Pollution; Waste disposal; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Conventional treatments; Environmental concerns; Environmental issues; Environmental pollutions; Palm oil mill effluents; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Palm oil","Al-Gheethi, A.; Micropollutant Research Centre (MPRC), Department of Water and Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Built Environmental, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Micropollutant Research Centre (MPRC), Department of Water and Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Civil Engineering and Built Environmental, Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia, Batu Pahat, Malaysia",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",01932691,,,,"English","J.

Our SLR addresses the question, “What is the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of RTW interventions for mental illness related sickness absences?” Methods This SLR used a reviewer pair multi-phase screening of publically available peer-reviewed studies published between 2002 and 2019. Five electronic databases were searched: (1) MEDLINE 1946–Present, (2) MEDLINE: Epub–Ahead of Print and In-Process, (3) PsycINFO, (4) Econlit, and (5) Web of Science. Results 6138 unique citations were identified. Ten articles were included in the review. Eight of the ten studies were conducted in the Netherlands, one in Sweden, and one in Canada. Results of this SLR suggest there is evidence that RTW interventions for workers with medically certified sickness absences can be cost-effective. Conclusions Although this SLR’s results suggest that economic evaluations of RTW interventions can be cost-effective, the use of economic evaluations for studies of these program types is in its infancy. Some jurisdictions (e.g., the Netherlands) seem to have recognized the need for economic evaluations. However, more research is needed in different disability system contexts. Furthermore, use of the standard economic evaluation approaches for healthcare interventions may limit the usefulness of results if the end-user is an employer or non-health organization. This may present the opportunity to introduce newer approaches that include work-related measures of effectiveness and analytical approaches. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Cost-effectiveness analysis; Economic evaluation; Mental illness; Systematic literature review; Work disability program",,"Dewa, C.S.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and Department of Public Health Sciences, University of California, Davis, 2450 48th Street, United States; email: csdewa@ucdavis.edu",,"Springer",10530487,,JOCTE,,"English","J.

Despite rising academic interest, the non-adoption of digital innovation or consumer resistance has received less scholarly attention as compared to the factors driving the adoption of digital products and services. The existing research on consumer resistance is also in siloes, running across multiple verticals, spanning from resistance to green products to the Internet of things (IoT). The current study provides a systematic review of the extant literature on consumer resistance to digital innovations by utilising the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. A total of 54 studies were selected for content analysis to isolate thematic foci, identify research gaps, recommend future research avenues and develop a framework. Our analysis revealed that the extant literature could be grouped under broad research themes, namely resistance to digital innovations, organisational resistance to technological innovations, resistance to technological healthcare innovations and consumer resistance to innovations (offline). The results of this SLR study are expected to galvanise future research in this area from the theoretical as well as from a practice-oriented perspective by providing various actionable inputs to combat consumer resistance to digital innovations. © 2020","Barriers; Consumer resistance; Digital innovations; Innovation resistance; Non-adoption; Passive and active resistance",,"Dhir, A.; Norwegian School of Hotel Management, University of StavangerNorway; email: amandeep.dhir@uis.no",,"Elsevier Australia",14413582,,,,"English","Australas.

In particular, it looks at the state-of-the-art of this domain from two angles. On the one hand, it investigates the participation of citizens in the development of public displays. On the other hand, it aims at understanding how public displays may foster citizen participation in addressing urban issues. Its goal is to provide a literature review of this field, and a research agenda. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following a thoroughly detailed protocol. It surveys 34 recent papers through multiple aspects, including interaction modality, level of participation, socio-demographics of participating citizens, topic of participation, evaluation of the display and participation of end-users in the early development stages of the display. Then, a research agenda informed by the results of the SLR is discussed in light of related literature. Findings: The SLR showed that further research is needed to improve the involvement of citizens in the early stages of the development of public displays, broaden the spectrum of citizen participation achieved through public displays, integrate public displays with other means of participation and handle the changing urban context to improve the participation experience. Originality/value: Previous literature reviews have been conducted in the field of public displays, including one specifically related to citizen participation. However, they have emphasized the technological aspects of public displays and omitted other essential aspects.

Many architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) firms have reported significant competitive advantages following its implementation. Despite the variety of benefits that BIM offers, its potential has not yet been fully realised. A key reason for this can be located in the difficulties of implementation at the organisational level; a process that demands significant changes in organisational business structure. However, there exists little extensive study on the analysis and synthesis of the literature surrounding organisational BIM implementation. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on studies from 2004 to July 2019 to allow for a thorough synthesis of the existing BIM literature, innovation management, and information technology domains to identify BIM adoption and implementation enablers. Of the 80 selected studies, 27 enablers were identified to contribute to a more comprehensive utilisation of BIM at the organisational level.

Despite the efficiency of HEVC, it still lacks reliable and practical functionalities to support authentication and copyright applications. In order to provide this support, several watermarking techniques have been proposed by many researchers during the last few years. However, those techniques are still suffering from many issues that need to be considered for future designs. In this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is introduced to identify HEVC challenges and potential research directions for interested researchers and developers. The time scope of this SLR covers all research articles published during the last six years starting from January 2014 up to the end of April 2020. Forty-two articles have met the criteria of selection out of 343 articles published in this area during the mentioned time scope. A new classification has been drawn followed by an identification of the challenges of implementing HEVC watermarking techniques based on the analysis and discussion of those chosen articles. Eventually, recommendations for HEVC watermarking techniques have been listed to help researchers to improve the existing techniques or to design new efficient ones. © 2013 IEEE.","Authentication; copyright; H.265; HEVC; SLR; systematic review; video; watermarking","Authentication; Efficiency; Watermarking; Future designs; High-efficiency video coding; Potential researches; Systematic literature review (SLR); Video coding standard; Watermarking algorithms; Video signal processing","Elrowayati, A.A.; Department of Electronic Engineering, College of Industrial TechnologyLibyan Arab Jamahiriya; email: elrowayati@yahoo.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087792152

Behavioral reasoning theory (BRT) is a relatively new theory that determines the linkage between beliefs, reasons, motives, intentions, and behavior. This study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) to synthesize the existing body of knowledge around BRT. The present SLR critically examines the origin of this theory and its linkages with other behavioral theories, thus providing insightful knowledge on its foundations. Further, it presents the state-of-the-art research knowledge, research themes, implications, and future directions related to BRT literature. Our analysis shows that the reasons for and reasons against construct plays an important role in predicting consumer behavior. This study also finds that research related to BRT is growing rapidly and needs methodological advancements. These findings will enable scholars and practitioners to better understand how BRT works, what its strengths and potential are, the contexts in which it has been utilized, its existing limitations, and the sort of methodological advancements needed in future studies on marketing. © 2020 The Author(s)","Behavioral reasoning theory (BRT); Behavioral theories; Consumer behavior; Marketing and systematic literature review",,"Dhir, A.; School of Business and Management, LUT UniversityFinland; email: amandeep.dhir@lut.fi",,"Elsevier Australia",14413582,,,,"English","Australas.

In fact, in the past decade, many secruity maturity models are still being produced and remain unproven regardless of the existence of ISO 21827. Design/methodology/approach: The authors have used the systematic literature review to summarize existing research, help identify gaps in the existing literature and provide background for positioning new research studies. Findings: The authors highlighted the prevalent influence of the ISO/IEC 27001/27002 standard but raised the necessity for an in-depth investigation of ISO 21827. The authors also made the implementation facet a central topic of our review. The authors found out that, compared to the number of proposed models, implementation experiments are lacking. This could be due to the arduous task of validation and it could also be the reason why specific models are dominant.

The number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) in Software Engineering (SE) is increasing but we do not know about the extent of GL usage in these SLRs. Moreover, Google Scholar is rapidly becoming a search engine of choice for many researchers but the extent to which it can find the primary studies is not known. Objective: This tertiary study is an attempt to i) measure the usage of GL in SLRs in SE. Furthermore this study proposes strategies for categorizing GL and a quality checklist to use for GL in future SLRs; ii) explore if it is feasible to use only Google Scholar for finding scholarly articles for academic research. Method: We have conducted a systematic mapping study to measure the extent of GL usage in SE SLRs as well as to measure the feasibility of finding primary studies using Google Scholar. Results and conclusions: a) Grey Literature: 76.09% SLRs (105 out of 138) in SE have included one or more GL studies as primary studies. Among total primary studies across all SLRs (6307), 582 are classified as GL, making the frequency of GL citing as 9.23%. The intensity of GL use indicate that each SLR contains 5 primary studies on average (total intensity of GL use being 5.54). The ranking of GL tells us that conference papers are the most used form 43.3% followed by technical reports 28.52%. Universities, research institutes, labs and scientific societies together make up 67.7% of GL used, indicating that these are useful sources for searching GL. We additionally propose strategies for categorizing GL and criteria for evaluating GL quality, which can become a basis for more detailed guidelines for including GL in future SLRs. b) Google Scholar Results: The results show that Google Scholar was able to retrieve 96% of primary studies of these SLRs. Most of the primary studies that were not found using Google Scholar were from grey sources. © 2013 IEEE.","empirical evaluation; Google scholar; gray; Grey literature; quality checklist; software engineering; systematic mapping; tertiary study","Search engines; Software engineering; Empirical evaluations; Google scholar; gray; Grey literature; Systematic mapping; Tertiary study; Mapping","Afzal, W.; School of Software, Tsinghua UniversityChina; email: wasif.afzal@mdh.se",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081118214

However, although increasingly used, it is difficult to find a clear meaning and definition of what the term represents. Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), using text-mining and machine learning algorithms, this article investigates what are the conceptual basis of the nexus governance debate, and attempts to clarify the main themes, networks, and gaps within this literature. The analysis is based on quantitative and qualitative methods, combining social network analysis (SNA) and discourse analysis (DA). The results highlighted that twenty-four governance-related concepts support this literature, breaking down into eight groups: water and basin governance; environmental and systems governance; risk and resource security governance; economic governance; global governance; urban governance; integrative and cooperative governance; and “epistemic” and transdisciplinary governance. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Because there is no comprehensive study on the FC in health management processing systems techniques, this paper aims at surveying and analyzing the existing techniques systematically as well as offering some suggestions for upcoming works. Design/methodology/approach: The paper complies with the methodological requirements of systematic literature reviews (SLR). The present paper investigates the newest systems and studies their practical techniques in detail. The applications of FC in health management systems have been categorized into three major groups, including review articles, data analysis, frameworks and models mechanisms. Findings: The results have indicated that despite the popularity of FC as having real-time processing, low latency, dynamic configuration, scalability, low reaction time (less than a second), high bandwidth, battery life and network traffic, a few issues remain unanswered, such as security. The most recent research has focused on improvements in remote monitoring of the patients, such as less latency and rapid response. Also, the results have shown the application of qualitative methodology and case study in the use of FC in health management systems. While FC studies are growing in the clinical field, CC studies are decreasing. Research limitations/implications: This study aims to be comprehensive, but there are some limitations. This research has only surveyed the articles that are mined, according to a keyword exploration of FC health, FC health care, FC health big data and FC health management system. Fog-based applications in the health management system may not be published with determined keywords. Moreover, the publications written in non-English languages have been ignored. Some important research studies may be printed in a language other than English. Practical implications: The results of this survey will be valuable for academicians, and these can provide visions into future research areas in this domain. This survey helps the hospitals and related industries to identify FC needs. Moreover, the disadvantages and advantages of the above systems have been studied, and their key issues have been emphasized to develop a more effective FC in health management processing mechanisms over IoT in the future. Originality/value: Previous literature review studies in the field of SLR have used a simple literature review to find the tasks and challenges in the field. In this study, for the first time, the FC in health management processing systems is applied in a systematic review focused on the mediating role of the IoT and thereby provides a novel contribution. An SLR is conducted to find more specific answers to the proposed research questions. SLR helps to reduce implicit researcher bias. Through the adoption of broad search strategies, predefined search strings and uniform inclusion and exclusion criteria, SLR effectively forces researchers to search for studies beyond their subject areas and networks. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cloud computing; Fog computing; Health management systems; Internet of things","Bandwidth; Cloud computing; Fog; Fog computing; Internet of things; Network security; Remote patient monitoring; Surveys; Design/methodology/approach; Dynamic configuration; Health management systems; Inclusion and exclusions; Internet of Things (IOT); Non-English languages; Qualitative methodologies; Systematic literature review (SLR); Information management","Lv, Q.; Hebei Normal UniversityChina; email: qinglvvv@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0368492X,,,,"English","Kybernetes",Review,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078912897

Making smart data-driven decisions will help the organizations to ride the waves toward invaluable investments. The successful implementation of Big Data projects depends on their alignment with the current organizational, technological, and analytical aspects. Identifying the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for Big Data is fundamental to overcome the challenges surrounding Big Data Analytics (BDA) and implementation. In recent years, the investigations related to identifying the CSFs of Big Data and Big Data Analytics expanded on a large scale trying to address the limitations in existing publications and contribute to the body of knowledge. This paper aims to provide more understanding about the existing CSFs for Big Data Analytics and implementation and contributes to the body of knowledge by answering three research questions: 1) How many studies have investigated on Big Data CSFs for analytics and implementation?, 2) What are the existing CSFs for Big Data Analytics, and 3) What are the categories of Big Data Analytics CSFs?. By conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for the available studies related to Big Data CSFs in the last twelve years (2007-2019), a final list of sixteen (16) related articles was extracted and analyzed to identify the Big Data Analytics CSFs and their categories. Based on the descriptive qualitative content analysis method for the selected literature, this SLR paper identifies 74 CSFs for Big Data and proposes a classification schema and framework in terms of 5 categories, namely Organization, Technology, People, Data Management, and Governance. The findings of this paper could be used as a referential framework for a successful strategy and implementation of Big Data by formulating more effective data-driven decisions. Future work will investigate the priority of the Big Data CSFs and their categories toward developing a conceptual framework for assessing the success of Big Data projects. © 2013 IEEE.","Big data (BD); big data analytics (BDA); big data challenges; big data implementation; critical success factors (CSFs); information system success; maturity; readiness; systematic literature review (SLR)","Big data; Data Analytics; Digital storage; Information management; Metadata; Conceptual frameworks; Content analysis method; Critical success factor; Data driven decision; Digital transformation; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Advanced Analytics","Al-Sai, Z.A.; School of Computer Science, Universiti Sains MalaysiaMalaysia; email: z_alsai@yahoo.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088317743

Women are working hard to not raise their living standard but also support their families. A lot of work has been done in developed countries regarding women entrepreneurship. It is necessary to find out what are the issues women must face in emerging economies. The purpose of this study is to review the literature on women entrepreneurship in emerging economies especially SAARC countries in last 23 years. This study will also critique the extant body of women entrepreneurship. With the help of identified aggregate dimensions, future studies will be shaped. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been undertaken across 23 journals present on the database SCOPUS. The initial search shows a total of 180 articles on the topic of interest. After refining the articles, a total of 76 articles have been selected to perform SLR. GIOIA methodology has been used to analyze the data of 76 articles. First-order concepts were collected directly from the articles. Second-order themes have been shaped on the basis of first-order concepts. Hence, aggregate dimensions have been made to summarize and contextualize the whole analysis. Separate analysis has been done on emerging economies and for the SAARC countries. Within the 76 articles of emerging economies, articles were separated based on the countries of SAARC Region. A total of 30 articles were obtained. Analysis has been done to study the context of South Asia in particular. This SLR finds that every region has its own social and cultural challenges affecting differently to women entrepreneurs. The dynamics of developing countries are very different from developed countries. The key elements of the future research implications of this study call for more qualitative and quantitative research. It will help to provide more insights a holistic view of the real stories and will help to understand the phenomena better. This paper presents the SLR of women entrepreneurship in emerging economies in focus to SAARC countries. This paper only describes, analyzes and critiques the existing literature found on a database SCOPUS. It also highlights the areas where there is a huge gap in literature. Hence the topic of interest has been established as worthy investigation in its own right.

While systematic reviews (SLRs) examine the effects of insufficient sleep and driving, to date, no SLR focuses on driver fitness or performance in shift workers. Objectives: Determine the class of evidence (Class I-highest to Class IV-lowest), and level of confidence (Level A-high, to Level U-insufficient) in the determinants of driver fitness and performance in shift workers. Next, consider evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice, research, and policy. Methods: A protocol was registered on PROSPERO (#CRD42018052905) using an established SLR methodology: a comprehensive electronic database search, study selection, data extraction, critical appraisal, analysis, and interpretation using published guidelines. Results: Searches identified 1226 unique records with 11(2 on-road, 9 simulator) meeting final inclusion criteria. Class III to IV evidence identified that exposure to overnight shift work possibly predicts (Level C confidence) drivers at risk for adverse on-road outcomes and likely predicts (Level B) drivers at risk for adverse driving simulator outcomes. Higher ratings of subjective sleepiness and extended time driving possibly predict (Level C) drivers at risk for adverse driving simulator outcomes. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a low to moderate level of confidence in the determinants of driving in shift workers. A critical need exists for gold-standard on-road assessments integrating complex driving environments representative of real-world demands, targeting tactical and strategic outcomes in a broad spectrum of shift workers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cognition; Driving; Shift work; Sleep deprivation; Systematic literature review","Accidents; Automobile drivers; Automobile simulators; Clinical research; Digital storage; Roads and streets; Search engines; Sleep research; Cognition; Driving; Shift work; Sleep deprivation; Systematic literature review; C (programming language); adult; car driving; complication; female; human; male; risk assessment; sleep deprivation; somnolence; traffic accident; wakefulness; work schedule; Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Automobile Driving; Female; Humans; Male; Risk Assessment; Sleep Deprivation; Sleepiness; Wakefulness; Work Schedule Tolerance","Knott, M.; i-Mobile Research Lab, Elborn College, Western University, 1201 Western Road, Canada; email: mknott@uwo.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",00014575,,AAPVB,"31443915","English","Accid.

Security is a significant issue for WSN due to its infrastructure and limited physical security. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is one of the most vulnerable attacks that can be defined as attacks launched from multiple ends into a set of legitimate sensor nodes in the WSN to drain their inadequate energy resources. Nowadays, Artificial intelligence techniques are performing better accuracy than the traditional methods to detect intrusion for the various attack. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) attempts to investigate the current status of DDoS detection techniques and to identify the most capable and effective detection system using artificial intelligence to detect distributed DoS attack. Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement is used to conduct this review. Based on 15 out of 983 that met inclusion criteria, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is the most used AI-based techniques to detect distributed denial of service attack in the wireless sensor network.

Design/methodology/approach: By using the Scopus database, a total of 86 papers related to PtD in construction published in peer-reviewed journals were reviewed and analysed using the well-established systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. Findings: The review indicates that in order to be competent in PtD implementation, designers need to be equipped with tacit and explicit knowledge, technical and soft skills and experience related to PtD. Furthermore, the review identifies attributes of these competencies. Additionally, a framework that links key PtD elements/principles with the PtD competencies is presented. Practical implications: The findings would enable contribution to the industry by providing the necessary references for design organisations to improve their designers' PtD competencies and hence, be able to meet their responsibility under relevant occupational safety and health (OSH) legislative framework. Originality/value: This study extends the PtD literature in the construction context by providing deeper insights into the conceptualisation of relationship between competent designers and PtD elements.

Also, advocates believed that it could occur in almost every software project, which leads to compromise in quality, delayed schedules, increase cost and decreased customer satisfaction. However, the lack of empirical evidence demands a comprehensive investigation to identify the factors of scope creep and to propose a conceptual framework to empirically evaluate the impact of scope creep on software project success. To determine the scope creep factors in this study, two exploratory methods, i.e. a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and interview from experts are performed. Following the analysis of these methods, a conceptual framework is proposed. To empirically evaluate the proposed conceptual framework, data is collected through a survey method. Next, the collected data is analyzed through Partial Least Squares' Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). From the results, it is evident that the identified factors of scope creep are negatively associated with software project success. The results of empirical evaluation also second the findings of SLR. The outcome of the study may help the practitioners to understand the dynamics of factors, which undermine scope creep in software SMEs and to assist them in the development of effective control and mitigation strategies, therefore, to increase the project success rate. © 2013 IEEE.","partial least squares structural equation modeling; requirement creep; scope creep; Scope management; software project success","Creep; Customer satisfaction; Least squares approximations; Software engineering; Conceptual frameworks; Empirical evaluations; Empirical investigation; Mitigation strategy; Partial least square (PLS); Software project management; Structural equation modelling; Systematic literature review (SLR); Project management","Janjua, U.I.; Department of Computer Science, Comsats University IslamabadPakistan; email: uzair_iqbal@comsats.edu.pk",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088695400

NFV increases network function, allocation, and flexibility, for the implementation of new network services, The benefits from optimizing resource allocation in NFV data center include automation of the operational processes, reducing the operational efforts, and lowering capital costs. Despite being a hot topic, NFV data centers are still in their early stages. In this sense, there are some aspects involved in the current NFV implementations that required further investigation, such as performance evaluation and managemen. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of NFV applications in data center. Therefore, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted aimed at studying and synthesizing the available works in the NFV state-of-the-art. Consequently, about 1,408 papers have been analyzed and filtered, evidencing a total of 65 relevant studies. This paper documents the relevance of the 65 papers, as well as provides an indepth insight into the primary open research questions concerning NFV architecture. In particular, highlighting the need for consolidating the integration of NFV in data centers by solving problems related to performance, dependability, resource allocation, cost, management, and resource interoperability. Based on the conducted SLR, several research gaps and open challenges have been identified, allowing the authors to provide new propositions and suggested future research avenues. Finally, the obtained results have shown that there is a strong need for further collaboration between academia and industry to conduct quality research and advance NFV practical implementations. © 2013 IEEE.","cloud computing; data center; Network function virtualization (NFV); performance evaluation; service function chain (SFC); software defined networking (SDN)","Cloud computing; Computer network performance evaluation; Function evaluation; Information management; Resource allocation; Transfer functions; Data centers; Operational process; performance evaluation; Research questions; Service functions; Software defined networking (SDN); Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Network function virtualization","Souza, R.; Centro de Informática, Universidade Federal de PernambucoBrazil; email: rrs4@cin.ufpe.br",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082525140

This study answers three research questions. The first question is how the number of published papers about Big Data modeling and management has evolved over time. The second question is whether the research is focused on semi-structured and/or unstructured data and what techniques are applied. Finally, the third question determines what trends and gaps exist according to three key concepts: the data source, the modeling and the database. As result, 36 studies, collected from the most important scientific digital libraries and covering the period between 2010 and 2019, were deemed relevant. Moreover, we present a complete bibliometric analysis in order to provide detailed information about the authors and the publication data in a single document. This SLR reveal very interesting facts. For instance, Entity Relationship and document-oriented are the most researched models at the conceptual and logical abstraction level respectively and MongoDB is the most frequent implementation at the physical. Furthermore, 2.78% studies have proposed approaches oriented to hybrid databases with a real case for structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Literature review; Management; Modeling","detection method; literature review; management practice; questionnaire survey; satellite laser ranging","Martinez-Mosquera, D.; Department of Informatics and Computer Science, Escuela Politécnica NacionalEcuador; email: diana.martinez@epn.edu.ec",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079600161

A typical embedded system project involves multi-domain experts such as business unit, software developers, hardware engineers and firmware developers. Agile methods have been successfully adopted in software engineering in general, and more recently in embedded safety critical development. A previous systematic literature review (SLR), conducted as part of this research, reported that one of the challenges of embedded safety-critical software development is multi-domain stakeholder communication. Additionally, suitable agile practices which have been used in embedded safety critical domains have been investigated. This earlier work proposed a process using a combination of suitable agile practices to support multi-domain stakeholder communication. In order to validate this proposed process, an expert review has been conducted. This paper outlines the proposed process and the findings of the expert validation.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify previous economic evaluations in migraine from the United Kingdom or Irish perspective to critically appraise these evaluations and to propose, if necessary, a novel modelling approach that can be used for future economic evaluations of migraine therapies. Methods: An SLR was conducted to identify previous economic evaluations of preventive migraine treatments. Key opinion leaders were consulted to determine the criteria for a robust migraine economic evaluation. Economic evaluations identified in the SLR were appraised against these criteria, and a novel cost-effectiveness model structure was then proposed. Results: Eight records reporting on published economic evaluations were identified and critically appraised for general quality. Expert consultation provided 6 recommendations on the ideal model structure for migraine that is both clinically and economically meaningful. A decision-tree plus Markov structure was then developed as a cost-effectiveness model for migraine therapies where each health state is associated with a patient distribution across monthly migraine day (MMD) frequencies. Conclusions: Future migraine economic evaluations should allow for assessments across the full spectrum of migraine, a response-based stopping rule, and the estimation of benefits and resource costs based on MMD frequency. The approach proposed in this paper captures all of the desired elements for an economic evaluation of migraine therapy and is suitable to assess new migraine therapies. © 2020, © 2020 Novartis Pharma AG.

Organizations tend to adopt new methodologies for global software development, among which is the use of agile in the GSD industry, which yields both benefits and challenges. However, software development teams do not consider situational needs that delay software delivery, resulting in the late discovery of incompatible assumptions and architecture level rework. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the situational factors that need to be considered by software development teams before developing a software product. We further present taxonomical classification and comprehensively map the situational factors that impact design development and advancement in the proposed Situational Agile Distributed Development (SADD) model. We propose 18 directed hypotheses against each situational factor that supports our SADD model. In order to evaluate our directed hypotheses, statistical analysis method is used, and the level of confidence of each directed hypothesis is validated. The result of our study confirms that global software development teams are highly reliant on the SADD Model. Our study will largely contribute by devising a multilevel taxonomy of situational factors that elevate the performance of global software development teams. This taxonomical classification will allow to better map the relationships between multiple situational factors and elevate the process of creating a holistic model to handle situational needs in the context of Agile Distributed Software Development (ADSD). © 2013 IEEE.","Agile distributed taxonomy; agile distributed teams; situational agile distributed development; situational model; taxonomical model","Taxonomies; Distributed development; Distributed software development; Distributed teams; Global software development; Situational modeling; Software development teams; Statistical analysis methods; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design","Yang, S.; School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang UniversityChina; email: ysk@buaa.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078260706

The approaches proposed are almost never based on the existing ones and their validation is often performed in a very limited number of projects. For this reasons, practitioners are confused and find difficult to apply such approaches in their projects. Goals: This paper investigates the available techniques for evaluating TD using automated tools aiming at helping practitioners and researcher in understanding the available options and apply them correctly. Method: The study has been performed as a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) applied to 835 studies obtained from the three largest digital libraries and databases. Results: After applying all filtering stages, 38 papers out of 835 have been selected and analyzed in depth. Almost all of them propose novel approaches to measure TD using different criteria and they do not extend or validate existing approaches. Conclusions: The area is not mature and it lacks independent evaluations of the models proposed. Authors focus on proposing new approaches and no consolidation can be identified. Moreover, almost all the approaches proposed are automated only partially and through prototype tools designed just to support the studies analyzed in the paper in which the approach is proposed and rarely maintained. These facts makes difficult the application of such methods by practitioners. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Literature review; Measurement; Technical debt; Tools","Digital libraries; Information systems; Information use; Measurement; Tools; Automated tools; Literature reviews; New approaches; Prototype tools; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technical debts; Automation","Sillitti, A.; Innopolis UniversityRussian Federation; email: a.sillitti@innopolis.ru","Filipe J.Smialek M.Brodsky A.Hammoudi S.","Springer",18651348,9783030407827,,,"English","Lect.

This study presents the outcomes of a systematic literature review of empirical evidence on the capabilities of multimodal data (MMD) for human learning. This paper provides an overview of what and how MMD have been used to inform learning and in what contexts. A search resulted in 42 papers that were included in the analysis. The results of the review depict the capabilities of MMD for learning and the ongoing advances and implications that emerge from the employment of MMD to capture and improve learning. In particular, we identified the six main objectives (ie, behavioral trajectories, learning outcome, learning-task performance, teacher support, engagement and student feedback) that the MMLA research has been focusing on. We also summarize the implications derived from the reviewed articles and frame them within six thematic areas. Finally, this review stresses that future research should consider developing a framework that would enable MMD capacities to be aligned with the research and learning design (LD). These MMD capacities could also be utilized on furthering theory and practice. Our findings set a baseline to support the adoption and democratization of MMD within future learning technology research and development. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Capturing and measuring learners’ engagement and behavior using MMD has been explored in recent years and exhibits great potential. There are documented challenges and opportunities associated with capturing, processing, analyzing and interpreting MMD to support human learning. MMD can provide insights into predicting learning engagement and performance as well as into supporting the process. What this paper adds Provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical evidence on MMD for human learning. Summarizes the insights MMD can give us about the learning outcomes and process. Identifies challenges and opportunities of MMD to support human learning. Implications for practice and/or policy Learning analytics researchers will be able to use the SLR as a guide for future research. Learning analytics practitioners will be able to use the SLR as a summary of the current state of the field. © 2020 The Authors.

Oral iron supplementation is often poorly tolerated or yields inadequate response, requiring the use of intravenous iron (IVI) in some patients. Administration of certain IVI preparations has been associated with decreases in serum phosphate levels and clinically significant hypophosphatemia, which has been reported to lead to adverse events including serious fatigue and osteomalacia. Objective: The purpose of this study was to systematically assess the prevalence, clinical consequences, and reporting of treatment-emergent hypophosphatemia within literature investigating IVI therapies marketed in the United States (US). Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using the PubMed database to identify publications reporting serum phosphate levels or rates of hypophosphatemia within adult IDA patient populations receiving current US-marketed IVIs. Results: The SLR yielded 511 unique publications, with 40 records meeting the final inclusion criteria. Most studies did not report phosphate monitoring methodology or an explicit definition of hypophosphatemia. Hypophosphatemia rates ranged from 0.0% to 92.1% for ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), 0.0% to 40.0% for iron sucrose, 0.4% for ferumoxytol, and 0.0% for low-molecular-weight (LMW) iron dextran. Randomized controlled studies described hypophosphatemia as “asymptomatic” or did not report on other associated sequelae. Eleven case reports detailed treatment-emergent hypophosphatemia in patients treated with FCM. Patients with acute hypophosphatemia primarily developed severe fatigue; those with repeated FCM dosing developed chronic hypophosphatemia associated with osteomalacia and bone deformities. Conclusion: Studies analyzed in this SLR reported a range of hypophosphatemia rates, with the highest consistently seen in patients treated with FCM. Across the clinical literature, there appeared to be minimal standardization of phosphate monitoring and definitions of hypophosphatemia. Although multiple cases have documented serious clinical consequences of hypophosphatemia associated with certain IVIs, current trials neither consistently nor adequately assess the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent hypophosphatemia and may underestimate its prevalence. © 2020, Dove Medical Press Ltd..

However, considerable research on freight network design lacks a comprehensive consideration of the application of distribution innovations. This observation implies that sustainable urban freight research appears highly fragmented in topics of network design and distribution innovations. From the perspective of long-term planning, this situation possibly serves as a barrier to further promotion of sustainability. The objective of this paper is to analyze existing research gaps of literature to further promote the sustainability of urban logistics systems from a future perspective. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs a systematic literature review (SLR) method, which covers 164 papers and research works published in 2013–2018. The article corpus involved the innovative schemes of freight network design and the emerging delivery concepts in cities. Based on an analysis of articles' relevance, the most significant research contributions on both city logistics network design and exploitation of distribution innovations are detected. Findings: This paper has found four research gaps in aspects of network design and distribution innovations. To respond to these gaps, we propose the research framework of sustainable and flexible future urban freight planning (SFFUFP) based on trends of city development, while discussing further research direction on urban freight planning. Originality/value: The authors have found four research gaps in aspects of both urban freight network design and distribution innovations in which scholars could be encouraged to contribute. The research framework of SFFUFP can further promote sustainable urban logistics from a view of future management. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","City logistics; Sustainability; Systematic literature review; Urban distribution innovations; Urban freight network design; Urban freight transport",,"He, Z.; Faculty of Business Studies and Economics, Universität Bremen, International Graduate School for Dynamics in Logistics, Universität BremenGermany; email: zhe@uni-bremen.de",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09600035,,,,"English","Int.

Recently, DB assessment has become an emerging topic of great importance. However, in view of to the stochastic nature of driving, measuring and modeling, DB continues to be a challenging topic today. As such, this paper argues that to move forward in understanding the individual and organizational mechanisms influencing DB, a conceptual framework is outlined whereby DB is viewed in terms of different dimensions established within the Driver–Vehicle–Environment (DVE) system. Moreover, DB assessment has been approached by various machine learning (ML) models. Still, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way, furthermore, ML based DB models often face problems and raise questions that must be resolved. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the DB investigation concept; In the first phase, a framework for conceptualizing a holistic approach of the different facets in DB analysis is presented, as well as a scheme to guide the future development and implementation of DB assessment strategies. In the second phase, an overview of the literature on ML is designed, revealing a premier and unbiased survey of the existing empirical research of ML techniques that have been applied to DB analysis. The results of this study identify an interpretive framework incorporating multiple dimensions influencing the driver's conduct, in an attempt to achieve a thorough understanding of the DB concept within the DVE system in which the drivers operate. Additionally, 82 primary studies published during the last decade and eight broadly used ML models were identified. The findings of this review prove the performance capability of the ML techniques for assessing DB. The models using the ML techniques outperform other conventional approaches. However, the application of ML models in DB analysis is still limited and more effort is needed to obtain well-formed and generalizable results. To this end, and based on the outcomes obtained in this work, future guidelines have been provided to practitioners and researchers to grasp the major contributions and challenges in the state-of-the-art research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Conceptual framework; Driving behavior analysis; Machine learning; Systematic literature review","Learning systems; Stochastic systems; Conceptual frameworks; Driving behavior; Machine learning techniques; Organizational mechanisms; Performance capability; Surrounding environment; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Machine learning","Elamrani Abou Elassad, Z.; LISI Laboratory, Computer Science Department, FSSM, Cadi Ayyad UniversityMorocco; email: z.elamrani@uca.ma",,"Elsevier Ltd",09521976,,EAAIE,,"English","Eng Appl Artif Intell",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073975446

The novelty of the content analysis is that it has been accomplished using an automated process of keyword extraction from the systematically selected literature using a Python-implementation of the popular Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction (RAKE) algorithm. Finally, the paper proposes a pentagram that successfully incorporates five dimensions of sustainability: environmental, economic, social, institutional and cultural, with an overarching component of innovation likely to have an impact on each due to technological advancements and future trends.

The objective was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) and exploratory network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare the tolerability and effectiveness of SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres, regorafenib, TAS-102 (trifluridine/tipiracil), and best supportive care (BSC) as third-line treatment in patients with mCRC. Methods: An SLR was conducted to identify studies comparing two or more of the treatments and reporting overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, tumor response, or adverse event (AE) incidence. An exploratory NMA was conducted to compare hazard ratios (HRs) for OS using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Results: Seven studies were identified in the SLR: two double-blind randomized-controlled trials (RCT) for each drug, one open-label RCT, and two non-randomized comparative studies for SIRT. Patient selection criteria differed between studies, with SIRT studies including patients with liver-dominant colorectal metastases. Nausea and vomiting were more frequent with TAS-102 than regorafenib or SIRT; diarrhea was more common with TAS-102 and regorafenib than SIRT. The exploratory NMA suggested that all active treatments improved OS, with HRs of 0.48 (95% CrI 0.30–0.78) for SIRT with Y-90 resin microspheres, 0.63 (0.38–1.03) for TAS-102, and 0.67 (0.40–1.08) for regorafenib each compared to BSC. Conclusions: Regorafenib, TAS-102 and SIRT using Y-90 resin microspheres are more effective than BSC in third-line treatment of mCRC; however, study heterogeneity made comparisons between active treatments challenging. SIRT is a viable treatment for third-line mCRC and its favorable AE profile should be considered in the therapeutic decision-making process. © 2020, The Author(s).","Colorectal cancer; Meta-analysis; Neoplasm metastasis",,"Pollock, R.F.; Covalence Research Ltd, 51 Hayes Grove, United Kingdom; email: pollock@covalence-research.com",,"Springer",01715216,,JCROD,"32715436","English","J.

This interest derives not only from their unique characteristics in terms of their management but more specifically in terms of their succession in a dimension that does not impact on other companies in the same way. Hence, and as a complex field of research, this study seeks to map out and analyse the intellectual knowledge on research into family firms in Asian contexts. Design/methodology/approach: As regards the statistical and analytical methods, the authors made recourse to the bibliometric, co-citation and cluster analysis techniques. In order to evaluate any potential patterns among the articles, the authors analysed the ways in which the articles are jointly cited. This furthermore applied hierarchical cluster analysis to the totality of the articles subject to co-citation analysis within the scope of grouping the interrelated articles into distinct sets. In order to graphically map the bibliographic co-citation analysis, the authors deployed the network and cluster determination theories. Findings: The results enabled the identification and the classification of various theoretical perspectives on the domain of family firms into four main approaches: (1) family business behaviour; (2) family versus non-family CEOs; (3) business family performance; and (4) business family and people.

Researchers and practitioners have focused on agile software development methods (ASDMs) as an alternative to overcome these problems. Agile methods employ iterative development cycles, interspersed by user feedback. Agile methods were basically developed for small development teams. Scaling agile methods is a big issue from different perspectives. De-motivators play a key role in project management as it allows early identification and prompt management of threats that may arise during project execution. The objective of this paper is to identify the de-motivators while scaling agile at large, from management perspectives. We have adapted SLR and applied contrived search criteria derived from the research questions, followed by selecting the required research papers, data extraction, and data synthesis, which resulted in 15 de-motivators from 58 relevant papers. Some of the identified de-motivators are ‘traditional organizational culture’, ‘lack of agile experts’, ‘reluctance to adopt’, and ‘lack of management and commitment support’. The identified factors have been compared from various perspectives, such as continents, digital libraries, organization size, and so forth. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","agile software developement; agile transformation; de-motivators; risk factors; systematic literature review","Digital libraries; Human resource management; Iterative methods; Project management; Agile Methodologies; Agile software development; Iterative development; Organization sizes; Organizational cultures; Research questions; Software development projects; Software development teams; Software design","Faisal Abrar, M.; Computer Software Engineering, University of Engineering & Technology, MardanPakistan; email: abrarfaisal49@gmail.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",20477481,,,,"English","J.

ISSP provides an important role in the successful use of information systems in Higher Education in the form of the realization of benefits. Therefore ISSP needs to be built properly by utilizing the appropriate ISSP builder methods, to produce ISSP products that can provide benefits realization. Current ISSP building methodologies commonly used are frameworks such as Business Systems Planning (BSP), Ward and Peppard (W&P), Zachman Enterprise Architecture (EA), Enterprise Architecture Planning (EAP), EA TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework), Tozer, PPDIOO (Prepare, Plan, Design, Implementation, Operate, Optimize) and EUP (Enterprise Unified Process). Commonly produced ISSP products are Blueprint(BLPT), Application Portfolio(APPF), EA Model(EAMD), Strategic Planning (STPN), Master Plan(MTPN), and Road Map (RDMP). The results of research that discuss building methodologies and ISSP products are currently being conducted at Higher Education in Indonesia, but there is still little research that discusses the exploration of the accumulated use of the ISSP method, ISSP products, and mapping of ISSP methodologies to ISSP products. This exploration effort is useful in obtaining reality and phenomena related to ISSP product development methodologies and their mapping. The research aims to explore the method of ISSP builders and products and their mapping at Higher Educations in Indonesia in the period 2009 to 2019 by utilizing the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. The results of this study provide synthesis and mapping related to the ISSP builder method and products in Indonesia. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

Materials and methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) identified relevant RCTs of ≥12 Weeks duration. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and grey literature were searched through October 2018. NMAs indirectly compared SGLT inhibitors and metformin for change from baseline in HbA1c, weight, total daily insulin dose and systolic blood pressure at Week 24 to 26 and Week 52. Safety outcomes were also explored. Results: Nine trials (N = 6780) were included in the SLR. NMAs indicated that all therapies performed better than placebo for the efficacy outcomes at both time points. Compared with metformin at Week 24 to 26, the SGLT inhibitors dapagliflozin (5 mg), sotagliflozin (200 mg) and empagliflozin (10 mg) had larger reductions in HbA1c (mean difference [MD] = −0.24, 95% credible interval [CrI], −0.41 to −0.07, MD = −0.23, 95% CrI, −0.39 to −0.08 and MD = −0.35, 95% CrI, −0.51 to −0.19, respectively) and in weight, which were sustained in sensitivity analyses. There were few differences observed in the results of safety outcomes, such as risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which should be interpreted cautiously because of wide CrIs. Conclusions: Adjunctive use of SGLT inhibitors in T1DM can improve glycaemic control compared with metformin while enabling weight loss, with consistent efficacy across the class.

The techniques for RA can be selected according to data type and data availability. On balance, semi-quantitative RA techniques seem to be a good compromise in risk estimation. For applying these techniques, it is necessary to build the hierarchy scale of Probability, Severity and Risk Index. The Fuzzy Logic (FL) approach is useful when dealing quantitatively with imprecision and has been applied in a wide range of fields, being a valuable tool for professionals who deal with Human Factors and human contingencies, and relevant in both RA and decision-making process of which workers’ safety and health rely on. This work aims at evidencing the pertinence of the use of FL theory to semi-quantitative RA techniques by a systematic literature review (SLR). The early results highlight the pertinence of the use of FL approach to analyze RA and the need for continuity. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Collaborative qualitative analysis; Fuzzy logic theory; Risk assessment; Risk management; Safety","Errors; Fuzzy logic; Human engineering; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Data availability; Decision making process; Fuzzy techniques; Informed decision; Occupational safety; Risk estimation; Safety and healths; Systematic literature review (SLR); Occupational risks","Leão, C.P.; ALGORITMI Centre, Department of Production and System, School of Engineering, University of MinhoPortugal; email: cpl@dps.uminho.pt","Arezes P.M.Boring R.L.","Springer",21945357,9783030509453,,,"English","Adv.

However, this usefulness come at the expense of the usability of these devices in some contexts. Thus, usability becomes an important factor in the adoption of mobile applications (such as mobile tracking applications, mobile health and mobile learning), which are often used by people who have problems when using mobile devices and who have a limited experience of technology. It is critical in the Mobile domain to ensure the success of mobile applications. Despite some studies review usability evaluation, regrettably there are no systematic literature reviews focused on usability evaluation of mobile tracking applications. Consequently, in this study, the researchers strive to present the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) involving the use of usability evaluation techniques in Mobile tracking applications. Based on three research questions, the results indicated that, there are three kinds of the Mobile tracking applications namely: information tracking, location tracking, information, and location tracking. In addition, and regard to the techniques used to evaluate the usability, the experimental study was the regularly used in the selected studies. Finally, the results shown that, for characteristics were frequently exploited to measure the usability of mobile tracking application are Effectiveness, Efficiency, Usefulness and Accurate.

This has forced the KSA administration to encourage sports related activities for a healthy life style. In this article, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is presented to discuss the current state of Physical Activity (PA) and sports activities in KSA and Other Countries in the World (OCW). The article also presents issues that hinder the success of physical and sports activities development in KSA to identify research gap. Methods: SLR search was conducted using ScienceDirect, Springer, Journal of health sciences and Google Scholar databases. The databases electronic search produced 553 articles at the initial stage. Some of these articles were eliminated since they did not conform to inclusion criteria. Finally a total of 58 articles satisfied the condition and were included for the study. Results: The literature highlighted that the studies investigating the male respondents is quite low having 3 in KSA and 0 in OCW, as against 7 in KSA and 0 in OCW for Females. In addition, the empirical analyses of the result based on this SLR concluded that the sports related studies in KSA are very low as compared to OCW. The study revealed that the main factors that hinder the success of physical and sports activities in KSA universities among males are lack of energy, motivation, self-confidence, and time, while among females, they are lack of social support and resources. Conclusion: It is not encouraged to participate in sports activity in Saudi Arabia. Despite the protests to promote sports activities there is very little action in this area as compared to OCW. Therefore, further research is needed to realize the potential in this area KSA to realise the vision 2030 and goal. © 2020 by authors, all rights reserved.","Health Promotion and KSA Vision 2030; Issues; Physical and Sports Activities; The Current State of Sports; University",,"Sayyd, S.M.; Department of Physical Education, Faculty of Education, Taibah UniversitySaudi Arabia",,"Horizon Research Publishing",23814381,,,,"English","Intern.

Design/methodology/approach: The study adopts a novel multi-evidence-based approach comprising Denyer and Tranfield's (2009) systematic literature review (SLR) with context, intervention, mechanism and outcome (CIMO) logic, text mining and network analysis. The approach constitutes a rigorous methodology that cross-validates results and ensures the reliability and validity of findings. Findings: The authors identified key knowledge gaps in the literature and explored the main contribution categories (e.g. conceptual understandings, operational impacts, use of theories and frameworks). Subsequently, we developed a contextual framework of ambidextrous coopetition to design RFSCs. Finally, an empirical research agenda is proposed with the five research directions to address the gap and take forward the notion of ambidextrous coopetition and RFSCs. Research limitations/implications: The multi-evidence-based approach is a structured and triangulated SLR approach and thus lacks empirical study. Practical implications: This research proposes a contextual framework of ambidextrous coopetition that can be used by fashion companies to embed resilience into their structures and operations. This research also presents an agenda for the future empirical research. Originality/value: This paper contributes by providing a combinatory synthesis on the role of ambidexterity and coopetition in designing RFSCs. This paper introduces a novel methodological triangulation for improving the quality and validity of SLRs. It identifies significant knowledge gaps and defines directions for future research. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ambidexterity; Ambidextrous coopetition; Coopetition; Fashion supply chains; Resilience; Supply chain management",,"Hasan, R.; Brunel Business SchoolUnited Kingdom; email: r_hasan_81@yahoo.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17410398,,,,"English","J.

However, IoT suffers from different issues, such as limited battery life, low storage capacity, and little computing capacity. For this reason, in many IoT applications and devices, we require an alternative unit to execute the tasks from the user's device and return results. In general, the problem of limited resources by transferring the computation workload to other devices/systems with better resources is addressed by offloading computation. It can be focused on improving the application, extending battery life, or expanding storage capacity. The offloading operation can be performed based on various quality of service (QoS) parameters that contain computational demands for load balancing, response time, application, energy consumption, latency, and other things. Moreover, the systematic literature review (SLR) method is used to identify, assess, and integrate findings from all relevant studies that address one or more research questions on IoT offloading and conduct a comprehensive study of empirical research on offloading techniques.

Partly because of the fact that it is a recent field of practise and research and partly because the number of works developed in this field has grown rapidly, it is important to frequently update the perspectives on this field of investigation. Thus, this study aims to review the implementation of lean tools and techniques applied to hospital organizational areas in a five-year period, between 2014 and 2018, complementing some of the most relevant reviews already published. The most important criteria such as tools, methods and principles, hospital areas intervened, improvements and difficulties were assessed and quantified. Design/methodology/approach: As starting point for this systematic literature review (SLR), a set of selected pre-existing review publications was used to support the current study and as the ground base for the expansion of the studies about lean health care. The current study contemplated 114 articles from a five-year period between 2014 and 2018. A subset of 58 of these articles was critically assessed to understand the application of lean tools and methods in different hospital areas. Findings: The thorough analysis of selected articles show a lack of works in continuous improvement approaches when compared to the application of production organization methods, visual management and diagnosing and problem-solving tools. The reported improvement results demonstrate alignment with the principles and foundations of lean philosophy, but such results are presented in isolated initiatives and without robust evidence of long-term maintenance. Moreover, this study shows an evolution in the number of articles referring to lean implementation in hospital areas, but in its great majority, such articles report isolated implementations in different areas, not spreading those for the global organization. Thus, some of the main recommendations are the need to implement studies on complete flows of patients, drugs and materials, instead of isolated initiatives and strive to promote the cultural change of hospitals through structural changes, following new visions and strategic objectives, supported by real models of continuous structural and sustained improvement. Originality/value: The current study develops a new perspective of the articles published under the thematic of lean health care, published in a recent period of five years, which are not completely covered by other works. Additionally, it explicitly applied, in an innovative way, an approach that used a set of previous reviews as the starting point for this SLR. In this way, it integrates approaches and categories from different SLRs, creating a framework of analysis that can be used by future researchers. Finally, it shows the most recent implementations of lean health care, exposing the current trends, improvements and also the main gaps. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lean health care; Operations management; Systematic literature review",,"Lima, R.M.; Department of Production and Systems, ALGORITMI Research Centre, School of Engineering, University of MinhoPortugal; email: rml@dps.uminho.pt",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20404166,,,,"English","Int.

In this evolution, the focus of the business management changes from a one-dimensional view—ruled, exclusively, by profit-driven—to a perspective that also considers social and ecological aspects, in the decision-making processes. This conception was established as a strategic approach and an innovative way to promote the sustainable development. Therefore, the aim of this article consists of investigating how the publications in national and international journals approach the relationship between sustainability and decision-making process between 2008 and 2017. For this purpose, an exploratory study is held, supported by Systematic Literature Review (SLR), for which the search and analysis procedure will take place in four database (Capes Journals Portal, Scopus, Science Direct and Scielo), using the SLR Roadmap as reference.

Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT) is the main framework for information technology governance (ITG) and defines the concept of IT governance enablers as a critical step for any governance decision or path. This investigation aims to clarify the enablers defined by COBIT to help organizations manage their information technology. Clarity on the meaning of enabler is still lacking in the literature. Enablers are somewhat described in COBIT, but space is left for confusion and contradictions among researchers and practitioners. The research question to be answered by this investigation concerns the definition for each enabler and how it is dictated by the COBIT framework. Further this study proposes a clarification concerning the definition of ITG enablers as addressed by COBIT and several filtration stages and criteria that were used to select highquality studies. Given the aim of this research, the authors adopted a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology to analyze and synthesize the knowledge about the enablers from COBIT from the literature.

We examine a proteomic test to address these limitations. Methods: This study examines the prognostic performance of the VeriStrat blood-based proteomic test that measures the inflammatory disease state of patients with advanced NSCLC. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed, yielding cohorts in which the hazard ratio (HR) was reported for overall survival (OS) of patients with VeriStrat Poor (VSPoor) test results versus VeriStrat Good (VSGood). A study-level meta-analysis of OS HRs was performed in subgroups defined by lines of therapy and treatment regimens. Results: Twenty-four cohorts met SLR criteria. Meta-analyses in five subgroups (first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, second-line single-agent chemotherapy, first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, and second- and higher-line TKI therapy, and best supportive care) resulted in statistically significant (p ≤.001) summary effect sizes for OS HRs of 0.42, 0.54, 0.41, 0.52, and 0.50, respectively, indicating increased OS by about two-fold for patients who test VSGood. No significant heterogeneity was seen in any subgroup (p >.05). Conclusions: Advanced NSCLC patients classified VSGood have significantly longer OS than those classified VSPoor. The summary effect size for OS HRs around 0.4–0.5 indicates that the expected median survival of those with a VSGood classification is approximately 2–2.5 times as long as those with VSPoor. The robust prognostic performance of the VeriStrat test across various lines of therapy and treatment regimens has clinical implications for treatment shared decision-making and potential for novel treatment strategies. © 2020, © 2020 Biodesix, Inc.

Methods: The inclusion criteria were autogenous iliac grafts and the following study designs: case control, cohort, clinical controlled trial (CCT), randomized CCT (RCCT), and previous SLRs. Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane, ProQuest and Google Scholar were the primary databases. Two calibrated examiners worked independently to select the articles. The MINORS evaluation method for surgical non-RCTs was used to assess for quality. Results: 1,111 articles were retrieved and 19 qualified. Different clinical and radiographic outcomes such as bone level, periodontal status, canine eruption and cleft-side tooth survival were evaluated by different assessment methods such as CBCT volume, computed tomography, periodontal evaluation, panoramic, intraoral radiographs, and Bergland scale. No RCCT or meta-analysis was found. None of the studies received the ideal score, which is 16 for non-comparison studies and 24 for comparison studies. Conclusion: Methodological variation, lack of standardization for initial cleft dimension and low-quality level rendered a fair comparison unfeasible. Although further studies are necessary, it can be assumed that early SABG also can be an acceptable option, but this was based on a single study with a reasonable level of evidence. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The application of AP in agriculture can reduce time spent in manual activities, avoid the indiscriminate use of chemicals, increase production costs, soil deterioration and environmental pollution. Nowadays, AP is a booming area that, taking advantage of technological advances, in computer vision, heterogeneous architectures (Multicore, GPU, FGPA) and artificial intelligence techniques (Machine learning, Deep learning), has allowed to systematize a variety of agricultural activities, such as disease detection, plant counting, and identification of weed, pests and insects in different crops. This paper presents a systematic review of literature (SRL) of image analysis and processing techniques applied in precision agriculture using heterogeneous technologies. Therefore, 32 scientific articles of the last five years from four relevant bibliographic databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink) were analyzed and synthesized. The selected publications answer to four research questions proposed in this study.

This task force (TF) aimed to develop evidence-based recommendations for the generic core competences of HPRs, with specific reference to nurses, physical therapists (PTs) and occupational therapists (OTs) to serve as a basis for their postgraduate education. Methods The EULAR standardised operating procedures for the development of recommendations were followed. A TF including rheumatologists, nurses, PTs, OTs, patient-representatives, an educationalist, methodologists and researchers from 12 countries met twice. In the first TF meeting, 13 research questions were defined to support a systematic literature review (SLR). In the second meeting, the SLR evidence was discussed and recommendations formulated. Subsequently, level of evidence and strength of recommendation were assigned and level of agreement (LoA) determined (0-10 rating scale). Results Three overarching principles were identified and 10 recommendations were developed for the generic core competences of HPRs. The SLR included 79 full-text papers, 20 of which addressed the competences, knowledge, skills, attitudes and/or educational needs of HPRs from multiple professions. The average LoA for each recommendation ranged from 9.42 to 9.79. Consensus was reached both on a research and educational agenda. Conclusion Evidence and expert opinion informed a set of recommendations providing guidance on the generic core competences of HPRs. Implementation of these recommendations in the postgraduate education of HPRs at the international and national level is advised, considering variation in healthcare systems and professional roles. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

Methods Databases including PubMed, EMbase, CINAHL, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, WanFang Data, VIP and CBM were searched electronically from January 2000 to December 2018 to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of SMS intervention on HIV patients. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included studies. Then, meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. Results A total of 10 RCTs with 2 411 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that SMS intervention could improve significantly treatment adherence of HIV patients (RR=1.11, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.20, P&lt;0.01). The subgroup analysis showed that weekly texting had an effect on treatment adherence (RR=1.15, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.33, P&lt;0.05); personal sending (RR=1.17, 95%CI 0.99 to 1.38, P=0.06) and daily sending (RR=1.02, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.26, P=0.84) of SMS had no statistical significance on treatment adherence; the intervention duration of 6 months (RR=1.11, 95%CI 1.00 to 1.23, P=0.05) could improve the treatment adherence, while the intervention duration of 12 months (RR=1.07, 95%CI 0.98 to 1.17, P=0.13) had no statistical difference on treatment adherence; there was no statistical difference in CD4+ cell count before and after treatment (WMD=4.18, 95%CI −39.33 to 47.69, P=0.85). Conclusions By comparing SMS intervention with routine nursing, sending SMS weekly for 6 months to remind HIV patients to take medicine can improve treatment adherence. Due to the limitation of quantity and quality of the included studies, the above conclusions are required to be assessed by more high-quality studies. © 2020 West China University of Medical Science.

It is influenced by the observation that there is a need for more systematic scrutiny of micro-level processes to deepen our understanding of academic entrepreneurship (Balven et al., 2018; Wright and Phan, 2018). The study proposes to answer to ‘What are the drivers of academic entrepreneurial intentions?’ and ‘What are the emerging topics for future research?’ Design/methodology/approach: The paper follows a Systematic Literature Review process (Tranfield et al., 2003) and adopts a four-step process format from previous literature reviews within the entrepreneurship context (Miller et al., 2018). From the results within Scopus and Web of Science databases, this research selected, evaluated, summarised and synthesised 66 relevant papers. Findings: This study provides a factor-listed representation of the individual, organisational and institutional variables that should be considered in the strategies defined by the university. Moreover, the study concludes that the push factors behind the intentions are multiple, context-dependent, hierarchy-dependent, heterogeneous and, at the same time, dependent on each other and against each other. Lastly, the study contributes to academic entrepreneurship literature, especially entrepreneurial intention literature, which has recently received more researchers' attention. Originality/value: The study corroborates that the individual factors, directly and indirectly via Theory of Planned Behaviour, strongly impact the academics' intentions. While the focus of the papers under review was an in-depth analysis of a selected group of factors, this SLR sought to compile the factors that were identified and provide a broader picture of all those factors to be considered by the university management. It contributes to the identification and clustering of the drivers that encourage academics to engage in knowledge valorisation activities, differentiating them by activity. For the practitioners, this list can be used by university managers, TTOs and department managers, and policymakers to guide questionnaires or interviews to analyse their academics' intentions and adequately support its academic engagement strategy. Lastly, this study also suggests worthwhile avenues for future research. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Academic entrepreneurship; Academic spin-off; Academics intention; Entrepreneurial university; Knowledge transfer; Literature review",,"Neves, S.; School of Economics and Management of the University of PortoPortugal; email: scneves@inesctec.pt",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02621711,,,,"English","J.

Secondary objectives included summarizing the types of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) used (if any), and related findings; and summarizing medical and non-medical reasons for treatment switch and/or discontinuation. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed, searching Medline and Embase for relevant publications. Results: In total, 70 relevant publications were identified. While the majority of these reported reasons for switching and/or discontinuing treatment, only four provided information explicitly regarding patient-reported experience of switching biologic treatment. All four utilized ranking tools to assess patient experience of switching biologic treatment. The most common reason for switching and/or discontinuing treatment was loss of efficacy, while the least common reason was patient preference. Conclusion: Although the number of available treatments in IA and UC have increased, there is a sparsity of information regarding patient-reported experience of switching biologic treatment. Further research regarding patient preference and/or experience would benefit this therapeutic area and help guide treatment choices. © 2020 Luttropp et al.","Arthritis; Biological products; Colitis; Patient reported outcome measures; Treatment switch; Ulcerative","abatacept; adalimumab; anakinra; biological product; biosimilar agent; certolizumab pegol; ct p 13; etanercept; golimumab; infliximab; rituximab; sb 4; tocilizumab; tofacitinib; ustekinumab; vedolizumab; biological therapy; human; meta analysis; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; patient attitude; patient experience; patient preference; patient-reported outcome; personal experience; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; systematic review; ulcerative colitis","Puenpatom, A.; Center of Observational and Real-World Evidence, Merck & Co., Inc.United States; email: puenpatom.amy@merck.com",,"Dove Medical Press Ltd.",1177889X,,,,"English","Patient Preference Adherence",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079602053

Design/methodology/approach: Systematic literature review (SLR) is selected as the main research method of the present paper, aiming to collect and critically analyze multiple research studies. This paper is not only limited to studies where the whole life cycle has been assessed but also includes other papers which only integrated BIM to analyze carbon footprint, embodied carbon dioxide (CO2) or energy consumption. Findings: Taking into account the countries that have published articles about the subject, it is possible to deduce that it has been studied in all of the continents, except Africa. In comparison with other continents, Asia and Europe have developed more studies. Furthermore, 76% of the 34 selected articles were published in journals and only 24% in conferences proceedings, and the number of papers that relates life cycle assessment (LCA) methods using BIM has grown from 2013 to 2015, proving that the current theme is relevant. Several aspects of this literature review show the need to develop automated processes for LCA of buildings during the project's development phase. There is already a tendency to compare LCA results for buildings applied to BIM models, contributing to decision-making related to alternate projects, selection of materials, suppliers and components from an environmental perspective. Originality/value: In the current global scenario, it is the notorious negative impact on the environment over the years caused by the architecture, engineering and construction industry (AEC). The integration of BIM–LCA can reduce time and improve the application of environmental analysis. Moreover, the proper application of a LCA method to evaluate the environmental impacts of the project can be hindered due to lack of information in the database about the materials or due to failures in the interoperability between BIM software and the LCA tool. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","BIM; Building life cycle; Building materials; Environmental impact; Green building; Project impact assessment; Sustainable buildings",,"Crippa, J.; Department of Civil Construction Engineering, Universidade Federal do Parana, GYRO–Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment Center, Federal University of Technology, ‐, PR, Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture, FAE Centro UniversitárioBrazil; email: julianna.crippa@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",2044124X,,,,"English","Built Environ.

In the systematic literature review (SLR) developed, it is possible to find references about strategies and factors that ease the implementation of the ITIL, static sequences for the processes to be implemented, and recommendations about the first process to implement, but it is rather complicated to find references that explicitly define the order (adapted to a specific company) of the processes to be implemented. Thus, once it is shown that there is no methodology/algorithm providing a sequence of ITIL processes specifically adapted for each company, an algorithm to solve this problem is presented: The algorithm has a deep mathematical basis and returns a sequence of ITIL processes to optimize the efforts during implementation, so the company implementing the ITIL gets the closest to the competitors. The optimization is made considering parameters such as staff, age of the company, IT size, industry, etc. Thus, the sequence proposed is specific for each company. Finally, a comparative of the sequence obtained (from the proposed algorithm) with sequences discovered in the SLR is presented and applied to a real case. © 2019 by the authors.","Algorithm; Implementation sequence; ITIL; Optimization; Process implementation order",,"Rubio, J.L.; UDIMASpain; email: juanluis.rubio@udima.es",,"MDPI AG",20763417,,,,"English","Appl.

Increasingly, treatments have sought to reflect personalised care and incorporate self-management (SM). However, the range of SM approaches proposed for foot and ankle MSK problems, and their relative clinical or cost-effectiveness, has not been reviewed. A scoping review is required to understand the need/appropriateness of a systematic review on this topic. Methods and analysis: The scoping review will be conducted in line with the PRISMA-ScR framework. We will perform an initial search across two databases to confirm search syntax. We will then complete a full search across three databases (Embase [Ovid], CINAHL [EBSCO], and Medline [EBSCO]) and grey literature (Cochrane Library, The British Library, The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health [CADTH], The Health Foundation, The Kings Fund, and MedNar). We will use a snowballing strategy to review the reference list of retrieved texts, as per inclusion criteria, to identify previously unretrieved texts of potential relevance. In an iterative process, the protocol outlined above will be refined and repeated as new key terms come to light. Ethics and dissemination: The scoping review will synthesise what is known and not known about SM approaches for MSK foot and ankle problems. The review will form the first step in outlining future research recommendations and areas of potentially unmet clinical need. The findings will be submitted for publication and shared in written form with stakeholder groups involved in the design of future research. © 2020 The Authors.

This study aims to identify the human factors that affect smartphone users’ threat avoidance behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: A structured literature review (SLR) was applied to answer the research question. A total of 27 sources were analysed, from which 16 codes emerged. After synthesis, six themes transpired. Findings: Six factors were identified as drivers and/or challenges of smartphone users’ threat avoidance behaviour, namely, knowledge and awareness, misconceptions and trust, cost and benefit considerations, carelessness, perceived measure effectiveness and the user’s perceived skills and efficacy. Research limitations/implications: The results can encourage and provide a starting point for further research on human behaviour to improve smartphone user behaviour. Practical implications: The mobile industry should focus on eradicating common misconceptions and undue trust in mobile security that is prevalent among smartphone users and make cost effective and usable interventions available. Training and awareness programs should be updated to include the factors that were identified in this study to affect smartphone users’ threat avoidance behaviour. In addition to improving users’ declarative knowledge concerning available smartphone measures and tools, procedural knowledge should also be improved to ensure proper use of available protective measures. Users should realise the importance of staying updated with evolving smartphone technology and associated threats. Originality/value: This study acknowledges and supports the notion that addressing human behaviour is crucial in the fight against mobile threats. It addresses the need for behavioural research to analyse the factors that drive smartphone user behaviour. Furthermore, it uses and documents the use of a SLR, a research technique often unfamiliar among information security researchers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Mobile threat; Smartphone user behaviour; Smartphones; Structured literature review; Threat avoidance behaviour",,"Butler, R.; School of Accountancy, Stellenbosch UniversitySouth Africa; email: rbutler@sun.ac.za",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20564961,,,,"English","Inf.

Wholly, FC is placed carefully around the IoT systems/sensors and develops cloud-based computing, memory and networking devices. Fog shares many similarities with the cloud, but the only difference between them is its location, in which fog devices are very close to end-users to process and respond to the client in less time. On the other hand, this system is useful for real-time flowing programs, sensor systems, and IoT that need high speed and reliable internet connectivity. However, there are many applications such as remote healthcare and medical cyber-physical systems, where low latency is needed. To reduce the latency of FC, the task scheduler plays a vital role. The task scheduling means to devote the task to fog resources in an efficient way. Yet, according to the findings, in spite of the preference of task scheduling techniques in the FC, there is not any review and research in this case. So, this paper offers systematic literature research about the available task scheduling techniques. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages associated with different task scheduling processes are considered, and the main challenges of them are addressed to design a more efficient task scheduler in the future. Additionally, according to the seen facts, future instructions are provided for these studies. Design/methodology/approach: The paper complies with the methodological requirements of systematic literature reviews (SLR). The present paper investigates the newest systems and studies their practical techniques in detail. The applications of task scheduling mechanisms in FC have been categorized into two major groups, including heuristic and meta-heuristic. Findings: Particularly, the replies to the project problem analyzed task scheduling are principal aim, present problems, project terminologies, methods and approaches in the fog settings. The authors tried to design his systematic discussion as precisely as possible. However, it might have still endured various confidence risks. Research limitations/implications: This study aimed to be comprehensive but there were some limitations. First, the usage of affair scheduling in fog settings are contained in many places such as editorial notes, academic publications, technical writings, Web pages and so on. The published papers in national magazines were omitted. Also, the papers with the purpose of a special task scheduling issue, which probably consider other subjects rather than affair planning issue are omitted. So, in the competence of this study, this systematic analysis must be considered as the studies published in the central international FC journals. Second, the given issues might not have considered the general task scheduling area, which points to the possibility of describing more related questions that could be described. Third, research and publication bias: five confident electronic databases were chosen based on past study experiments. Finally, the numbers show that these five electronic databases must suggest the most related and reliable projects. Yet, selecting all main performing projects has not been confirmed. Probably some effective projects were omitted throughout the processes in Section 3. Different from the conclusion, changing from the search string to the information extraction exists, and the authors tried to exclude this by satisfying the source in central projects. Practical implications: The results of this survey will be valuable for academicians, and it can provide visions into future research areas in this domain. Moreover, the disadvantages and advantages of the above systems have been studied, and their key issues have been emphasized to develop a more effective task scheduling mechanisms in the FC mechanisms. Originality/value: It is useful to show the authors the state-of-the-art in the fog task scheduling area. The consequences of this project make researchers provide a more effective task planning approach in fog settings. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fog computing; Review; Scheduling; Systematic; Task","Embedded systems; Fog; Internet of things; Multitasking; Publishing; Real time systems; Reviews; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Websites; Cloud based computing; Design/methodology/approach; Internet of thing (IOT); Literature researches; Medical cyber physical systems; Systematic; Systematic literature review (SLR); Task; Fog computing","Yang, X.; College of Technology and Business, Shandong Management UniversityChina; email: yangbo9448@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0368492X,,,,"English","Kybernetes",Review,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081294670

Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) focusing on SSc-related large calcified masses. Upon updating the terminology and definition, all cases of “pseudotumoral” calcinosis seen at the Cochin and Padova University Hospitals were reviewed. Results: The SLR yielded 30 SSc cases, with large calcified masses mainly defined as “tumoral” or “pseudotumoral”. Among the 629 SSc cases included in the Cochin and Padova cohorts, 19 (3%) living and 7 deceased patients were affected by pseudotumoral calcinosis; among these, the great majority had a severe vascular phenotype. The mean age in the whole population (56 cases) was 59 ± 11.4 years with a median disease duration at calcinosis onset of 7 (5–10) years. Twenty-five out of 56 patients (44.6%) had the diffuse cutaneous form of SSc. Anti-topisomerase I and anticentromere were found equally. Pseudotumoral calcinosis were commonly symmetrical and the size ranged from 2 to 15.5 cm. Most patients had multiple site involvement: 52% hand/wrist, 29% shoulders and elbows, 20% hips and 25% spinal calcinosis. Fistulization/ulceration and infections were reported in 32% and 23% of cases, respectively; nerve compression was found in 40% of spinal calcinosis and in one patient with limb calcinosis. There was no clear evidence of clinical and radiological improvement with any treatment. A partial improvement was seen in 7 patients that underwent surgery. Conclusion: Pseudotumoral calcinosis may occur in about 3% of SSc patients, commonly symmetrical and in multiple sites without differences regarding the cutaneous subtypes but often in those with a severe vascular phenotype. Medical treatment seems ineffective, whereas a surgical approach may be considered. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Calcinosis; Pseudotumoral; Systemic sclerosis; Tumoral; Vascular Phenotype",,"Allanore, Y.; Rhumatologie, Hôpital Cochin, APHP, Université de Paris, Hôpital Cochin, 27 rue du Faubourg Saint-Jacques, France; email: yannick.allanore@aphp.fr",,"W.B.

A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of immunomodulatory drugs in patients with non-infectious, non-neoplastic, non-anterior uveitis. The results of the SLR were presented and discussed during an expert meeting in which 34 recommendations were generated. The level of agreement with the recommendations was also tested in 25 additional experts following a Delphi process. Recommendations were voted from 1 (total disagreement) to 10 (total agreement). We defined agreement if at least 70% of the experts voted ≥7. The level of evidence and grade or recommendation were assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Results: The SLR included 33 articles. The 34 recommendations were accepted after 2 Delphi rounds (3 of them were modified after the first round). They include specific recommendations on patients with non-infectious, non-neoplastic, PU and PanU, as well as different treatment guidelines.

Stem cell therapy (SCT) is the injection of mesenchymal stem cells or stromal vascular fractions from adipose and other tissue sources. Although SCT has been studied and reported in multiple rodent trials, few human clinical trials exist. Aim: The aim of this study was to provide a systematic review of SCT for the treatment of ED with an emphasis on data from peer-reviewed human studies. Methods: A systematic review was performed evaluating SCT for ED in human studies using PubMed-Medline and Scopus databases. Literature search was conducted using key words such as “Clinical Trials of SCT for ED,” “Stromal Vascular Fraction Treatment for ED,” and “SCT for ED.” Systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Main Outcome Measure: The main outcomes measure was the safety and efficacy of SCT for ED in humans. Results: 5 studies specific to SCT for ED treatment were included. A total of 61 patients were included in these phase I and II clinical trials and follow-up periods ranged from 6−62 months. End points of the studies included safety, tolerability, and efficacy of SCT for ED. The majority of the studies demonstrated improvement in erectile function due to SCT in patients, including improvements in penile vascular flow, International Index of Erectile Function-15 items, and Erectile Hardness Scale scores. All of the studies reported that there were no serious adverse events for patients. Limitations of the studies included small cohort sizes, and only 1 contained a sham arm. Conclusion: The 5 completed human clinical trials show promise for SCT as a restorative therapy for the treatment of ED. However, although promising, there still exists very limited data for the use of SCT for ED in humans. With the expansion of clinics offering SCT for ED, it is imperative that SCT is investigated further for safety, efficacy, and standardization. Lokeshwar SD, Patel P, Shah SM, et al.

They reveal that Indonesia's ""Digital Islands"" are the largest internet user-base in the Southeast Asian region (150 million internet users in 2018), generate the largest internet economy ($27 billion in the year 2018) and operate the fastest-growing internet economy in Southeast Asia. However, the use of E-commerce itself in the sector of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia is still only between 9-15 %. The objective of this review is to establish a theoretical model that links digital business adoption, organizational innovation, frugal innovation type, and firm performance. A systematic literature review (SLR) is the method used for the critical review. The critical result of the review is used as the basis for the development of the concept. More than 864,000 publications released between 2014 and 2019 were screened using the keywords: digital business adoption, e-business adoption, e-commerce adoption, type of innovation, frugal innovation, organisational innovation, and firm performance. Eventually, for this study, 23 journals were included. Based on the analysis, the conceptual model has four possible connections: (1) The positive relationship between digital business adoption and SME achievements; (2) the good relationship between the adoption of digital businesses and organisational innovation; (3) the positive direct impacts of organizational innovations on company performance; and (4) a positive relationship exists between digital business adoption and frugal innovation type and organizational innovation.

FS analysis during radical prostatectomy (RP) can help to tailor the plane of dissection based on cancer extension and thus extend the indications for NS surgery. Evidence Acquisition: We performed a PubMed/Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Elton B. Stephens Co. (EBSCO)host search to include articles published in the last decade, evaluating FS analysis in the NS area and surgical attempts to convert a PSM to a negative status. Evidence Synthesis: Overall, 19 papers met our inclusion criteria. The ways to collect samples for FS analysis included: systematic (analysing the whole posterolateral aspect of the prostate specimen, i.e., neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen-section examination [NeuroSAFE]); magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided (biopsies from MRI-suspicious areas, retrieved by the surgeon in a cognitive way); and random biopsies from the soft periprostatic tissues. Techniques to address a PSM in the NS area included: full resection of the spared NVB, from its caudal to cranial aspect, often including the rectolateral part of the Denonvilliers’ fascia; partial resection of the NVB, in cases where sampling attempts to localise a PSM; incremental approach, meaning a partial or full resection that extends until no prostate tissue is found in the soft periprostatic environment. Conclusions: There is no homogeneity in prostate sampling for FS analysis, although most recent evidence is moving toward a systematic sampling of the entire NS area. The management of a PSM is variable and can be affected by the sampling strategy (difficult localisation of the persisting tumour at the NVB). The difficult identification of the exact soft tissue location contiguous to a PSM could be considered as the critical point of FS analysis and of spared-NVB management. © 2020 The Authors BJU International © 2020 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","frozen section; radical prostatectomy; sampling; surgical margins","Cochrane Library; fascia; frozen section; human; human experiment; human tissue; male; Medline; nerve; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prostate tissue; prostatectomy; review; soft tissue; surgeon; surgery; surgical margin; surgical technique; Web of Science","Sighinolfi, M.C.; Department of Urology, University of Modena & Reggio EmiliaItaly; email: sighinolfic@yahoo.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",14644096,,BJINF,"32012426","English","BJU Int.",Review,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080144576

Methods: Systematic literature review (SLR), nominal group meeting, and Delphi process. A panel of 12 experts was established who defined the scope, users, and sections of the document. We performed an SLR in order to assess the efficacy and safety of available drugs in patients with mCRPC. Abstracts from the American Society of Oncology and European Society for Medical Oncology meetings were also examined. The results were discussed during an expert meeting in which 14 recommendations were generated. The level of agreement with the recommendations was also tested by 13 additional experts following the Delphi process. Recommendations were voted by means of scores ranging from 0 (total disagreement) to 10 (total agreement). We defined agreement when at least 70% of the experts voted ⩾7. Next, we assigned a level of evidence and grade to the recommendation using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence, following which the final document was drafted. Results: The literature search did not find any articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Finally, 13 out of 14 recommendations were accepted after two Delphi rounds (two were modified after the first round). They pertain to general and individual case-based treatment recommendations. Conclusions: In mCRPC patients who have progressed after docetaxel or abiraterone plus ADT in the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer setting, these recommendations may support treatment decision-making, due to the lack of evidence or other globally accepted sequencing algorithms. © The Author(s), 2020.","abiraterone acetate; androgen-deprivation therapy; chemotherapy; enzalutamide; metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; radium-223","abiraterone; docetaxel; prostate specific antigen; algorithm; androgen deprivation therapy; antineoplastic activity; Article; bone scintiscanning; cancer growth; cancer prognosis; castration resistant prostate cancer; decision making; drug efficacy; drug safety; evidence based medicine; human; latitude; overall survival; palliative therapy; positron emission tomography; priority journal; progression free survival; quality adjusted life year; randomized controlled trial (topic)","González-del-Alba, A.; Medical Ongology Department, Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Calle Joaquin Rodrigo 2, Spain; email: aranzazu.gonzalezalba@salud.madrid.org",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",17588340,,,,"English","Ther.

Through this systematic review of literature and meta-analysis, we wished to fill this gap. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, African Journals Online, and Global Index Medicus as well as references of retrieved papers were searched to select studies addressing SLE in Native sub-Saharan Africans and published between January 1, 2008 and October 7, 2018. The prevalence of SLE and its characteristics were pooled through narrative review and random-effects model. Heterogeneity (I2) was assessed via the χ2 test. Pooled estimates are expressed with 95% confidence intervals. This study is registered with PROSPERO: registration number CRD42019139226. Results: Out of 1502 papers, 15 hospital-based studies were included. The pooled prevalence of SLE among 28,575 participants was 1.7% (0.8–2.9), with substantial heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 96.9% [94.8%; 98.1%], τ2 = 0.0020, p &lt; 0.0001). The mean age at diagnosis ranged from 28.8 to 39.2 years. The female proportion varied from 88% to 100%. Rheumatological (5.1%–99.9%), dermatological (4.3%–100%) and hematological (1.4–86.9%) manifestations were the commonest clinical features of SLE. Patients had a high seroprevalence for anti-ribonucleoprotein 57.9% (36.4–77.9), anti-Smith 53.5% (40.4–66.2), anti-Sjogren syndrome antigen A 45.6% (19.2–73.4) and anti-Sjogren syndrome antigen B 33.7% (13.6–57.6) autoantibodies. The most used treatments were corticosteroids 99% (94.9–100) and antimalarials 62. 8% (23.3–94.1). The pooled mortality rate was 10.3% (3.3–20.6) and death was mainly due to infections, kidney disease and neurological involvement. Conclusion: Over the last 30 years, SLE was not rare among Native sub-Saharan Africans and its featured characteristics were earlier onset, female predominance, and high seropositivity for extractable nuclear antigen autoantibodies. Corticosteroids and antimalarials were the standard treatments. The mortality rate was high. Population prevalence and incidence as well as full description of SLE characteristics in Native sub-Saharan Africans are needed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Native sub-Saharan Africans; Systemic lupus erythematous","acetylsalicylic acid; antimalarial agent; antinuclear antibody; autoantibody; azathioprine; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; Jo 1 antibody; La antigen; methotrexate; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; phospholipid antibody; ribonucleoprotein antibody; Ro antibody; scl 70 antibody; Sjoegren syndrome antigen A antibody; Sjoegren syndrome antigen B antibody; Sm antibody; unclassified drug; Africa south of the Sahara; African; cause of death; clinical feature; comorbidity; Embase; human; indigenous people; infection; kidney disease; Medline; meta analysis; mortality rate; prevalence; priority journal; Review; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment outcome; Web of Science","Essouma, M.; Department of Internal Medicine and Specialties, Faculty of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University of Yaoundé ICameroon; email: essmic@rocketmail.com",,"Academic Press",08968411,,JOAUE,"31668352","English","J.

Patients and Methods: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs), one each for the PROs and economic topics, were performed using MEDLINE and Embase to identify observational studies of adults with SCD. Included studies were published between 2007 and 2018 and evaluated health-related quality of life (HRQL), function, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU), or costs. Given the high degree of clinical and methodological heterogeneity, findings were summarized qualitatively. Results: The SLRs identified 7 studies evaluating the PROs and 15 studies evaluating the economic burden meeting the pre-specified selection criteria. The PRO evidence showed the prevalence of depression and anxiety to be 21–33% and 7–36%, respectively, in adults with SCD. The mean SF-36 physical summary scores ranged from 33.6 to 59.0 and from 46.3 to 61.5 for the mental summary scores. Overall HRQL for adults with SCD was poor and significantly worse in those with opioid use. Adult SCD patients were found to have varying rates of emergency department (ED) utilization (0.3–3.5 annual ED visits), hospitalizations (0.5–27.9 per patient per year), and/or readmission (12–41%). Key factors associated with significant HCRU were age, dental infection, and SCD-related complications. SCD specia-lized care settings and SCD intensive management strategy were reported to significantly decrease the number of hospitalizations. Conclusion: This systematic evidence synthesis found that disease burden measured by PROs and economic burden of SCD on adults in the US are substantial despite the avail-ability of approved SCD treatments during 2007–2018. The use of hydroxyurea, optimal management with opioids, and employing intensive treatment strategies may help decrease the overall burden to patients and healthcare systems. Published data on costs associated with SCD are limited and highlight the need for more economic studies to characterize the full burden of the disease. © 2020 Lee et al.","Economic burden; Health-related quality of life; Patient-reported outcomes; Sickle cell disease","age distribution; Article; cost effectiveness analysis; disease burden; economic aspect; emergency care; functional assessment; health care availability; health care cost; health care utilization; hospital readmission; human; patient-reported outcome; personalized medicine; quality of life; Short Form 36; sickle cell anemia; systematic review; tooth infection; United States","Lee, S.; NovartisUnited States; email: soyon.lee@novartis.com",,"Dove Medical Press Ltd.",11787074,,,,"English","Int.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the benefits of these agents in nAMD; however, results achieved under RCT protocols may not always be replicated in clinical practice. Assessing real-world outcomes is important to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these two agents. Our objective was to assess the real-world effectiveness of intravitreally administered aflibercept and RBZ in treatment-naive patients with nAMD and determine the cost-effectiveness of intravitreally administered aflibercept versus RBZ in a real-world setting. Methods: A multistage approach was undertaken. A systematic literature review (SLR) was completed to identify studies describing real-world outcomes in patients with nAMD treated intravitreally with aflibercept or RBZ. A meta-analysis of data identified in the SLR generated a pooled estimate of the effectiveness of intravitreally administered aflibercept and RBZ at 52 weeks and an estimate of treatment burden (injection frequency and monitoring). The impact of treatment effect modifiers, such as baseline visual acuity (VA) and age, were corrected through a multivariable meta-regression. A Markov state transition model was developed to estimate the real-world cost-effectiveness of intravitreally administered aflibercept using results from the pooled estimates for effectiveness and treatment burden as primary inputs. The analysis considered the perspective of the French National Healthcare System. Results: Patients treated intravitreally with aflibercept had a mean age of 79.52 years and mean baseline VA of 55.80 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. At week 52, mean VA gain was 5.30 ETDRS letters in patients reporting an average of 7.10 intravitreal injections of aflibercept and 8.65 visits (injection and/or monitoring). RBZ-treated patients were younger (77.28 years), with a lower mean baseline VA (52.81 ETDRS letters). At week 52, mean VA gain from baseline was 4.24 ETDRS letters, with an average of 5.88 injections and 10.10 visits (injection and/or monitoring). After correcting for differences in age (77.28 years) and baseline VA (52.81 ETDRS letters) and considering the current clinical practice with aflibercept and RBZ, the mean VA gain was 6.57 ETDRS letters for patients treated intravitreally with aflibercept and 4.42 ETDRS for patients treated intravitreally with RBZ. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that intravitreally administered aflibercept is a more effective treatment option with an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (4.918 versus 4.880) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €27,087 per QALY. Conclusions: The analysis identified differences in the overall treatment approach and how ophthalmologists use intravitreally administered aflibercept and RBZ in clinical practice. These differences ultimately influence the mean real-world effectiveness of the two agents. Intravitreal treatment with aflibercept (injection frequency and patients follow-up) was consistent and in line with the European label recommendations. Patients treated intravitreally with aflibercept in clinical practice reported a mean gain in VA of similar magnitude to the mean VA gain reported in the pivotal RCT. Conversely, treatment with RBZ varied significantly across the different studies. On average, RBZ-treated patients reported a low injection frequency and a frequent follow-up, driven in part by the high number of patients treated with pro re nata (PRN) regimens. RBZ-treated patients reported gains in VA versus baseline; however, the magnitude of the gain in VA was not comparable to the VA gains reported in the RBZ pivotal RCT. Intravitreal treatment with aflibercept was associated with better mean VA outcomes and an incremental gain in QALYs compared with RBZ and can be considered cost-effective for the treatment of nAMD in patients in France despite a higher price for each individual intravitreal injection of aflibercept compared with RBZ.

The traditional software development approaches do not perform well while dealing with the complexity and real time properties of WSNs. Consequently, Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is commonly applied in WSN to verify the required system constraints in preliminary development periods. As MDA is highly suitable development approach for WSN, there is a strong need to explore and summarize the latest MDA trends in the field of WSN. Therefore, this article performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify 27 research studies available during 2013-2018. This leads to classify the recognize studies into four MDA categories and five WSN groups. Moreover, 24 available tools are identified and organized into Model-driven (10), WSN-related (9) and other (5) groups. Furthermore, 12 tools developed by the researchers through the combination of MDA and WSN concepts are presented. In addition, MDA based algorithms (2) and protocols (2) for WSN are presented. Finally, comparative analysis of developed/proposed tools is performed to analyze the benefits and limitations of MDA for WSN. It is concluded that the major MDA attributes like reusability and early design verification are fully exploited in the domain of WSN.

The academic debate has analyzed several facets, but one deserves further analysis: its impact on the cost efficiency of public services. The purpose of this paper is to aim at systematizing the findings on the relationship between coproduction and cost efficiency and at developing insights for future research. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on a structured literature review (SLR), following the approach proposed by Massaro, Dumay and Guthrie. The SLR approach differs from traditional narrative reviews since, like other meta-analysis methods, it adopts a replicable and transparent process. At the same time, when compared to most common meta-analysis or systematic review logics, it is better suited to incorporate evidence from case studies and etnographies. This makes the method especially suited to public administration and management studies. Findings: Results shed light on the nature of the academic literature relating coproduction to cost efficiency, on what type of costs are affected and how and on the meaningfulness of productivity measures when public services are co-produced. Originality/value: In times of fiscal distress for many governments, the paper contributes to research and practice in systematically re-assessing the effects of coproduction on public budgets. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Coproduction; Cost efficiency; Public services; Structured literature review",,"Fedele, P.; Department of Economics and Statistics, University of UdineItaly; email: paolo.fedele@uniud.it",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",10963367,,,,"English","J.

Recent studies demonstrated their deep impact on species diversity, adaptation to the environment and diseases. Although there are many conventional bioinformatics algorithms for detecting and classifying TEs, none have achieved reliable results on different types of TEs. Machine learning (ML) techniques can automatically extract hidden patterns and novel information from labeled or non-labeled data and have been applied to solving several scientiﬁc problems. Methodology: We followed the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process, applying the six stages of the review protocol from it, but added a previous stage, which aims to detect the need for a review. Then search equations were formulated and executed in several literature databases. Relevant publications were scanned and used to extract evidence to answer research questions. Results: Several ML approaches have already been tested on other bioinformatics problems with promising results, yet there are few algorithms and architectures available in literature focused speciﬁcally on TEs, despite representing the majority of the nuclear DNA of many organisms. Only 35 articles were found and categorized as relevant in TE or related ﬁelds. Conclusions: ML is a powerful tool that can be used to address many problems. Although ML techniques have been used widely in other biological tasks, their utilization in TE analyses is still limited. Following the SLR, it was possible to notice that the use of ML for TE analyses (detection and classiﬁcation) is an open problem, and this new ﬁeld of research is growing in interest.

Design/methodology/approach: In a systematic literature review, 1106 articles indexed at Scopus were initially submitted to a bibliometric analysis. Finally, 150 papers published in a variety of academic journals specializing in the field of Entrepreneurship, KM and Higher Education were analyzed through a content and a bibliometric analysis to minimize mistakes in interpreting findings of collected studies. Findings: KM within entrepreneurial university is a research area of growing importance. Findings show that literature on KM models and tools in the entrepreneurial university is fragmented and dominated by unrelated research. Content analysis shows heterogeneous literature, but four major research streams emerge: knowledge transfer in university–industry collaboration; knowledge creation in entrepreneurship education; KM processes for university spin-offs; entrepreneurial university to support knowledge-based regional development. The results show a failure to address the implications of findings for policy makers, which risks making KM in entrepreneurial universities research irrelevant. Research limitations/implications: Although different structured literature reviews (SLRs) exist separately in the field of KM and entrepreneurial universities, to the authors’ best knowledge, no studies exist in the intersection between the two fields. Originality/value: The paper presents the first attempt to provide a comprehensive SLR of the articles dealing with models and processes of KM in the entrepreneurial university. Despite the increasing literature, this research area is still fragmented and undertheorized, thus requiring more systematic and holistic studies, considering both the economic and the social aspects of KM within universities. The paper’s findings can offer insights into future research avenues. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Entrepreneurial universities; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Spin-offs; Structured literature review; Technology transfer; Third mission",,"Ndou, V.; Department of Innovation Engineering, Universita del SalentoItaly; email: valentina.ndou@unisalento.it",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",00251747,,,,"English","Manage.

Insufficient sleep is associated with impaired neurocognitive functioning, affecting key skills required for driving, resulting in shift workers experiencing a disproportionate burden of RTC injuries and fatalities. Yet, to our knowledge, no systematic literature review (SLR) exists to critically appraise and synthesise evidence on the determinants of fitness to drive (assessed on-road) and driving performance (assessed in a driving simulator) in shift workers with insufficient sleep. Objectives A SLR protocol is established to conduct analysis and synthesis of the level of evidence and confidence in the determinants of fitness to drive and driving performance, among shift workers with insufficient sleep. Methods This study follows Cooper and Hedges' established SLR methodology: formulate the problem, locate and select studies, collect data, appraise critically, analyse and present data, interpret results and disseminate information. Critical appraisal and analysis follows the 2017 American Academy of Neurology guidelines determining the level of evidence and the level of confidence for each determinant identified in the literature. Protocol and results reporting adhere to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols guidelines. Conclusions This SLR contributes to research evidence examining the impact of insufficient sleep and driver sleepiness on fitness to drive and driving performance. Analysis of the level of evidence and level of confidence in the existing literature will advance evidence-informed prevention strategies and critical decision-making, to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep for improving road safety. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.","fatigue; motor vehicle; systematic review",,"Knott, M.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Western UniversityCanada; email: mknott@uwo.ca",,"BMJ Publishing Group",13538047,,,"30554167","English","Injury Prev.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058693653

To help alleviate this issue, systematic literature review and meta-analysis (SLR), which synthesize current evidence for a research question, can be applied to preclinical evidence to identify the most promising therapeutics. However, these methods remain time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here, we introduce an economic formula to estimate the expense of SLR for academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies. Methods: We estimate the manual effort involved in SLR by quantifying the amount of labor required and the total associated labor cost. We begin with an empirical estimation and derive a formula that quantifies and describes the cost. Results: The formula estimated that each SLR costs approximately $141,194.80. We found that on average, the ten largest pharmaceutical companies publish 118.71 and the ten major academic institutions publish 132.16 SLRs per year. On average, the total cost of all SLRs per year to each academic institution amounts to $18,660,304.77 and for each pharmaceutical company is $16,761,234.71. Discussion: It appears that SLR is an important, but costly mechanisms to assess the totality of evidence. Conclusions: With the increase in the number of publications, the significant time and cost of SLR may pose a barrier to their consistent application to assess the promise of clinical trials thoroughly. We call on investigators and developers to develop automated solutions to help with the assessment of preclinical evidence particularly. The formula we introduce provides a cost baseline against which the efficiency of automation can be measured. © 2019 Evid Science","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Clinical research; Clinical trial; Dollar cost; Labor costs; Machine learning; Meta-analysis; Systematic review","article; artificial intelligence; automation; clinical research; clinical trial (topic); drug industry; human; machine learning; meta analysis; preclinical study; publication; quantitative analysis; systematic review","Michelson, M.; Evid Science, 2361 Rosecrans Ave #348, El Segundo, United States; email: mmichelson@evidscience.com",,"Elsevier Inc",24518654,,,,"English","Contemp.

In this umbrella review, we summarized the current evidence on the biological determinants of PA across the life course, by pooling the results of the available systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs). Methods: We conducted an online search on MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases up to January 2018. SLRs and MAs of observational studies that investigated the association between biological determinants of PA and having PA as outcome were considered eligible. The extracted data were assessed based on the importance of the determinants, the strength of evidence, and the methodological quality. Results: We identified 19 reviews of which most were of moderate methodological quality. Determinants that were studied most frequently among all ages and demonstrated evidence suggesting a positive association to PA were younger age, being male, higher health status, and higher physical fitness levels. Among adults, normal birth weight was found to be positively associated to PA with convincing strength of evidence, while findings among adolescents were inconsistent and with limited strength of evidence. Conclusions: Different social or behavioral factors may contribute to the decrease of PA with age and among females versus males, and creating programmes targeted at diverse ages, female population, and adults with abnormal birth weight is recommended. Future studies should use prospective study designs, standardized definitions of PA, and objective measurement methods of PA assessment. © The Author(s). 2019.","Biological determinants; Physical activity; Umbrella systematic review","adolescent; adult; age; birth weight; body build; body mass; child; correlational study; data base; fitness; gender; health status; human; physical activity; preschool child; Review; risk factor; systematic review","Puggina, A.; Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Sezione di Igiene, Istituto di Sanità PubblicaItaly; email: annapuggina@gmail.com",,"Springer",21989761,,,,"English","Sports Med. - Open",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060587103

The most-reported problem in requirement engineering (RE) is the difficulty to identify quality requirements. Sometime analysts may face incorrect and incomplete requirements, which may become the reason for project failures from the perspective of dissatisfaction of stakeholders. Hence, the quality in each phase of RE is important. The main focus of this article is to categorizing, Identifying, and synthesizing the existing researches on quality enhancement of the RE process. The systematically reviewing the relevant studies based on the Kitchenham systematic review methodology is the main objective of this study. This review identifies the methods which are used for enhancing the quality of RE by improving requirement elicitation, requirement analysis and specification, and requirement validation process. In this research, we are not specific to any phase of RE. Hence, the techniques obtained for quality enhancement purpose can target different phases as we are going to deal with the overall quality of requirements to enhance different quality factors as defined by IEEE standards.

The IoT devices are used to generate data, which transforms into useable information and provides applied resources to end-users and this process is the main goal of IoT. Therefore, one of the important subjects in the IoT is resource allocation which aims is load balancing and minimizing operational cost, and power consuming. In addition, the resources should be allocated in such a way to be a balanced efficiency that can increase the system performance, Quality of Service (QoS) and Service Level Agreement (SLA). Although the resource allocation is very important in the IoT, there is no systematic review in this field. Therefore, in this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is provided and the resources allocation methods in the IoT and used algorithms are investigated. Different classification, including cost-aware, context-aware, efficiency-aware, load-balancing-aware, power-aware, QoS-aware, SLA-based and utilization-aware resource allocation mechanisms are organized to investigate the resource allocation techniques. We present several parameters and describe them in each category. In addition, the used parameters in different articles are evaluated and the major developments in each category are surveyed and are outlined the new challenges. Furthermore, an SLR is provided in each of these eight categories. In this paper, a structure of different technical keys in the scope of resource allocation in the IoT and its platforms are presented and the important areas for improving the resource allocation methods in the future is highlighted and the open issues about resource allocation in IoT to achieve a better utilization of this technology are focused. The future direction is useful for academic researchers that work on IoT.

We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to estimate each treatment's relative effectiveness and safety. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane to identify all phase III randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a time frame from January 1, 2010 to March 11, 2019. We retrieved evidence on treatment-related grade III/IV adverse events, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Evidence was synthesised using a Bayesian fixed-effect NMA. Reference treatment was dacarbazine. In accordance with RCTs, dacarbazine was pooled with temozolomide, paclitaxel and paclitaxel plus carboplatin. To increase homogeneity of the study populations, RCTs were only included if patients were not previously treated with novel treatments. Results: The SLR identified 28 phase III RCTs involving 14,376 patients. Nineteen and seventeen treatments were included in the effectiveness and safety NMA, respectively. For PFS, dabrafenib plus trametinib (hazard ratio [HR] PFS: 0.21) and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib (HR PFS: 0.22) were identified as most favourable treatments. Both had, however, less favourable safety profiles. Five other treatments closely followed (dabrafenib [HR PFS: 0.30], nivolumab plus ipilimumab [HR PFS: 0.34], vemurafenib [HR PFS: 0.38], nivolumab [HR PFS: 0.42] and pembrolizumab [HR PFS: 0.46]). In contrast, for OS, nivolumab plus ipilimumab (HR OS: 0.39), nivolumab (HR OS: 0.46) and pembrolizumab (HR OS: 0.50) were more favourable than dabrafenib plus trametinib (HR OS: 0.55) and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib (HR OS: 0.57). Conclusions: Our NMA identified the most effective treatment options for advanced melanoma and provided valuable insights into each novel treatment's relative effectiveness and safety. This information may facilitate evidence-based decision-making and may support the optimisation of treatment and outcomes in everyday clinical practice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advanced melanoma; Anti–CTLA-4; Anti–PD-1; Binimetinib; BRAF; Cobimetinib; Dabrafenib; Dacarbazine; Encorafenib; Ipilimumab; MEK; Network meta-analysis; Nivolumab; Pembrolizumab; Systematic literature review; Trametinib; Vemurafenib","binimetinib; carboplatin; cobimetinib; dabrafenib; dacarbazine; elesclomol; encorafenib; ipilimumab; nivolumab; oblimersen; paclitaxel; pembrolizumab; tasisulam; temozolomide; ticilimumab; trametinib; vemurafenib; antineoplastic agent; azetidine derivative; benzimidazole derivative; binimetinib; cancer vaccine; carboplatin; cobimetinib; dabrafenib; dacarbazine; elesclomol; fotemustine; hydrazine derivative; imidazole derivative; interleukin 2; ipilimumab; lenalidomide; melanocyte protein Pmel 17; monoclonal antibody; nitrosourea derivative; nivolumab; organophosphorus compound; oxime; paclitaxel; pembrolizumab; piperidine derivative; pyridone derivative; pyrimidinone derivative; sorafenib; temozolomide; trametinib; vemurafenib; advanced cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer grading; Cochrane Library; drug efficacy; drug safety; Embase; human; Medline; melanoma; meta analysis; Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; priority journal; progression free survival; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; immunology; melanoma; network meta-analysis; pathology; proportional hazards model; skin tumor; survival rate; treatment outcome; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Azetidines; Benzimidazoles; Cancer Vaccines; Carboplatin; Dacarbazine; gp100 Melanoma Antigen; Humans; Hydrazines; Imidazoles; Interleukin-2; Ipilimumab; Lenalidomide; Melanoma; Network Meta-Analysis; Nitrosourea Compounds; Nivolumab; Organophosphorus Compounds; Oximes; Paclitaxel; Piperidines; Progression-Free Survival; Proportional Hazards Models; Pyridones; Pyrimidinones; Skin Neoplasms; Sorafenib; Survival Rate; Temozolomide; Treatment Outcome; Vemurafenib","Franken, M.G.; Institute for Medical Technology Assessment, Erasmus University Rotterdam, PO Box 1738, Netherlands; email: franken@imta.eur.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",09598049,,EJCAE,"31670077","English","Eur.

Due to the rapid increase in the human demand of wireless networks worldwide. It required efficiency for the current generation, IEEE introduced the 802.11e standard for quality of service in 2005. This standard based on the EDCA mechanism for different priority traffic to provide QoS in WLANs. Nowadays EDCA is still one of the most important techniques of channel access for providing quality of service in the latest standards of IEEE for WLANs (802.11a, 802.11ax). EDCA based on four different traffic priorities (Voice, Video, Best effort, Background). The main contribution of this research is to systematically review researches on QoS enhancement of wireless LAN. This study Identifying, categorizing, and synthesizing the appropriate researches based on Kitchenham's systematic review methodology. This review identifies the methods which are used for improving the QoS of WLAN. We also focused on the issues as contention window adjustment and channel sensing which causes a lot of collision in EDCA.

Material and Methods: The first step was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) through an electronic database search. Case-controls that reported associations between genes and dental caries were the main type of study design used as inclusion criteria, retrieved from the PubMed and the Virtual Health Library databases, comprising the chronological range from 1982 to 2017. The SLR was guided by PRISMA protocol and the methodological quality of the studies was established through Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). In the second step, the String Protein Interaction (SPI) approach was used to analyze protein interaction (by esyN software) and also the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to check biological pathways associated with dental caries genes. Results: A total of 51 articles were included to perform this SLR, describing a number of 27 genes associated with dental caries development. At the genetic level, 23 genes have at least one other gene with which they interact. The genes TUFT1, VDR, TFIP11, LTF, HLA-DRB1, MMP2, MMP3 and MUC5B were shown to be connected in interactive networks by at least 10 other genes. Conclusion: It is essential to apprehend the multifactorial pattern of inheritance in human disease. This study presents pathways which may be directly correlated with several dental caries phenotype and this contributes to a better understanding of this disease, opening up a wider range of biotechnology options for its effective control in the future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Dental diseases; Epidemiology; Genetics","protein; case control study; dental caries; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; phenotype; physiology; Case-Control Studies; Dental Caries; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Phenotype; Proteins","Cavallari, T.; Graduate Program in Dentistry, Dentistry Department, School of Life Sciences, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná, Rua Imaculada Conceição 1155, Brazil; email: taylacavallari@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00039969,,AOBIA,"31476523","English","Arch.

Though ERPs success stories are published in past research studies, the failure rate of ERP systems is relatively high. The purpose of this study was to find issues and challenges and assess the degree of criticality of these issues/challenges faced by organizations during ERP implementation. Design/methodology/approach: For doing systematic review/research synthesis systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out considering research studies published within the time period, i.e. 1999-2018. Three major steps such as planning, conducting and reporting were followed to proceed further in this study. This study attempted to accomplish a critical review of 53 studies out of 103 studies identified, which were published in reputable journals to synthesize the existing literature in the ERP domain. The studies selected have almost addressed different challenges/issues faced by small and large organizations during ERP implementation. Findings: Research synthesis/SLR led to the identification of 31 issues/challenges, which may be termed as most critical based on their occurrence/frequency in past studies included. The topmost ten issues/challenges amongst 31 identified include top management approach, change management, training and development, effective communication, system integration, business process reengineering, consultants/vendors selection, project management, project team formation, team empowerment/skilled people and data conversing/migration. However, other issues/challenges identified such as security risks/data security, cloud awareness, functionality limitations, service level agreements and subscription expenses are more related to cloud ERPs. Originality/value: The current study is unique in its kind, focusing on the issues and challenges faced by organization during implementing ERP projects. Moreover, this study contributes to understanding and further analyzing management capabilities for developing remedial measures while planning the implementation of an enterprise system in their organizations prior to the occurrence of different issues and challenges ahead.

The diversity of these organizations makes it difficult to define proper terminology and organizational characteristics. PMS evolution has not yet been able to capture all performance dimensions of a public administration and, especially for NPO considering its dynamic and multiple goals. The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework that identifies and classifies the factors that influence the design of PMSs in NPOs and public administration. Design/methodology/approach: The study was developed through a systematic literature review (SLR). A set of 29 papers were intensely studied, and the results provide a multi-disciplinary and holistic set of factors. Findings: A set of ten factors that influence the design of PMSs in NPO and public administration were found. They were categorized into three groups: factor related to purpose, stakeholders and management. Originality/value: The study synthesized the literature and provided a conceptual framework of the factors that influence the design of PMSs in NPO and public administration. No individual paper collected in the SLR shows a similar organization of the factors as the present paper. The set of factors indicates the importance of this study for NPO and public administration, and how complex a PMS in an NPO and public administration can become. The conceptual model presented can further assist practitioners in developing design process observing the role that the identified factors play. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Design; Nonprofit organization; Performance measurement and management; Public administration",,"Moura, L.F.; Federal University of Technology – ParanáBrazil; email: louisifrancis@utfpr.edu.br",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17410401,,,,"English","Int.

The highlight in security is the security architecture. Many security systems that are created do not refer to the security architecture so it is difficult in its development. In addition, the current security architecture does not refer to the guidelines for the creation of security architectures according to [1] there are two parts of security zones and security layers so that only 8% of security architectures meet both sections. In this study, a survey was conducted to find out the development trend in SDN security and security architecture of SDN using systematic literature review (SLR) method, and SLR result stated that research in architecture of network security is still very relevant to be done.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted following the protocol from Pagani, Kovaleski and Resende (2015), called Methodi Ordinatio, to select the relevant literature on this topic. The analysis of papers selected was carried out following the procedures of categorical content analysis (Bardin, 1977). Findings: In all, 68 full papers were analyzed from Science Direct and Web of Science. The results present the main characteristics of publications analyzed and the authors propose some categories of strategic practices related to public procurement that are in turn related to: sustainability, partnerships and supplier management, information systems and technology and other issues. Research limitations/implications: The main limitations of this paper are: the publication period considered of the articles selected is from January 2012 to March 2017; the databases Science Direct and Web of Science are selected as the sources of articles; the Methodi Ordinatio is used as the basic protocol of the SLR and, consequently, the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the steps of the protocol are used. Practical implications: Showing how the public procurement can be strategic, this paper highlights the benefits of best procurement practices; similarly, it highlights those practices adopted by the private sector, which can highly contribute to the creation of value in public services that are aligned with the concept of obtaining “the best value for money”. Social implications: The incorporation of strategic practices in public procurement can result in the best expenditure of public resources and the reduction of corruption in the process of procurement. Originality/value: This paper contributes to synthesize the knowledge on strategic procurement, a topic exploited by few people in the public organizations. It differentiates from other literature reviews already published, considering that these studies do not deal, specifically, with public procurement and, also, do not use protocols of SLR.

In part address to this challenge, the purpose of this systematic review of literature (SLR) study is to investigate the use of the term ‘market access’ in its context of use in the generic literature and business sector discourse, in comparison to the more specific literature and discourse in fisheries, aquaculture and seafood. This SLR aims to uncover the knowledge/interest gaps between the academic subject discourses and business sector practices. Corpus driven in methodology and using a triangulation method of three different text analysis softwares including AntConc, VOSviewer and Web of Science (WoS) analytics, the SLR results indicate a gap in conceptual knowledge and business practices in how market access is conceived, studied and managed in the pharmaceutical and healthcare marketing industry in comparison to fisheries and aquaculture. FAIB's complexity is directly acknowledged in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Zero Hunger. And while the product orientation of different business sectors might differ, this SLR study works with the assumption that both business sectors are international in orientation, and complex in their operations from product to market. To that extent, research scholars and practitioners in FAIB will need to broaden their efforts in understanding the multiplicity of forces that influences fisheries and aquaculture and its international orientation towards both emerging as well as mature markets. This SLR suggests a conceptual model in understanding the challenges, the potential barriers as well as avenues for solutions to developing market access for FAIB. © 2019 Shanghai Ocean University","Bibliometric analysis; Concordance analysis; Fisheries and aquaculture; International business; Market access; Research methods; Systematic literature review",,,,"KeAi Communications Co.",20961758,,,,"English","Aquac.

Due to operational costs, safety concerns, and legal regulations, Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is commonly used to design models and conduct tests. This has resulted in numerous research works addressing ABS in civilian UAV applications. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the ABS contribution in civilian UAV applications by conducting a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the relevant research in the previous ten years. Following the SLR methodology, this objective is broken down into several research questions aiming to (i) understand the evolution of ABS use in civilian UAV applications and identify the related hot research topics, (ii) identify the underlying artificial intelligence systems used in the literature, (iii) understand how and when ABS is integrated in broader and more complex internet of things & ubiquitous computing environments, and (iv) identity the communication technologies, tools, and evaluation techniques used to design, implement, and test the proposed ABS models. From the SLR results, key research directions are highlighted including problems related to autonomy, explainability, security, flight duration, integration within smart cities, regulations, and validation & verification of the UAV behavior. © 2019","Agent-based simulation; Civilian applications; Multi-agent systems; Systematic literature review; Unmanned aerial vehicle","Antennas; Intelligent agents; Laws and legislation; Ubiquitous computing; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Agent based simulation; Artificial intelligence systems; Communication technologies; Hot research topics; Research questions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Ubiquitous computing environment; Multi agent systems","Mualla, Y.; CIAD, Univ.

To meet the stringent needs of safety standards such as ISO 26262 there is a need for efficient quantitative evaluation of the perceived information. However, to use typical methods of evaluation, such as comparing using annotated data, is not scalable due to the manual effort involved. There is thus a need to automate the process of data annotation. This paper focuses on the LiDAR sensor and aims to identify the limitations of the sensor and provides a methodology to generate annotated data of a measurable quality. The limitations with the sensor are analysed in a Systematic Literature Review on available academic texts and refined by unstructured interviews with experts.

However, software developers’ emotions are still an area under investigation and debate that is gaining relevance in the software industry. Objective: In this study, a systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out to identify, evaluate, and synthesize research published concerning software developers’ emotions as well as the measures used to assess its existence. Method: By searching five major bibliographic databases, authors identified 7172 articles related to emotions in Software Engineering. We selected 66 of these papers as primary studies. Then, they were analyzed in order to find empirical evidence of the intersection of emotions and software engineering. Results: Studies report a total of 40 discrete emotions but the most frequent were: anger, fear, disgust, sadness, joy, love, and happiness. There are also 2 different dimensional approaches and 10 datasets related to this topic which are publicly available on the Web. The findings also showed that self-reported mood instruments (e.g., SAM, PANAS), physiological measures (e.g., heart rate, perspiration) or behavioral measures (e.g., keyboard use) are the least reported tools, although, there is a recognized intrinsic problem with the accuracy of current state of the art sentiment analysis tools. Moreover, most of the studies used software practitioners and/or datasets from industrial context as subjects. Conclusions: The study of emotions has received a growing attention from the research community in the recent years, but the management of emotions has always been challenging in practice. Although it can be said that this field is not mature enough yet, our results provide a holistic view that will benefit researchers by providing the latest trends in this area and identifying the corresponding research gaps. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Affect; Behavioral software engineering; Emotion; Mood; Social aspects of software development; Systematic literature review","Information services; Sentiment analysis; Social aspects; Affect; Bibliographic database; Emotion; Mood; Physiological measures; Software practitioners; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design","Sánchez-Gordón, M.; Østfold University College, Faculty of Computer SciencesNorway; email: mary.sanchez-gordon@hiof.no",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070186672

The process is deeply dependent on interactions among the workforce (reviewer, and author) involved in process activities. Interactions among the MCR workforce are roots of various individual, social and personnel factors influencing the MCR process. Multiple research has been performed based on data analysis collected from review tools, surveys, and interviews at a single company concerning factors affecting MCR. However, MCR research is lacking systematized study concerning individual, social and personnel factors influencing the MCR process. Therefore, this study performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify individual, social and personnel factors influencing the MCR process. The study findings highlight individual factors (individual skills, characteristics, emotions, etc.), social factors (trust, relationship, interaction, impression, etc.) and personnel factors (team, team interaction, and reviewer response) that influence the MCR process. Study findings have implications for software engineering researchers performing research in the area and MCR team members to extend the research and perform MCR activities effectively by considering and overcoming the negative impact of identified factors. © 2019 IEEE.","individual; modern code review; personnel; social","Codes (symbols); Computer software selection and evaluation; Open systems; Quality control; Software quality; Code review; individual; Individual factors; Individual skills; Multiple research; Multistage process; social; Systematic literature review (SLR); Personnel",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728133102,,,"English","IEEE Conf.

Published studies present conflicting data regarding the impact of cigarette smoking on SLE risk, disease activity, clinical manifestations and treatment response. We performed a comprehensive literature search using Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Collaboration database, and hand searches of relevant bibliographies. All original studies investigating the relationship between smoking and SLE were included in TABALUP. Two investigators systematically extracted data from the relevant studies. When possible, meta-analyses were performed. The meta-analysis of 9 case-controls studies show an increased risk of SLE in current-smokers compared to never-smokers (OR: 1.49 [95%CI: 1.06–2.08]), while former-smokers were not at increased risk of SLE. Data on passive smoking remains scarce and controversial. Pooled analysis studies did not find an over-risk of anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm or anti-SSA positivity according to smoking status. Tobacco smoking significantly reduced the therapeutic effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in cutaneous lesions (pooled OR 0.53; 95%CI: 0.305–0.927) and belimumab in systemic manifestations (HR 0.10; 95% CI 0.02–0.43). In addition to its usual adverse effects, cigarette smoking is a risk factor of SLE and negatively influences the course of the disease and its treatment. We believe that smoking cessation should be one of the main target of physicians treating SLE patients. © 2019","Cigarette smoking; Meta-analysis; Risk; Systematic review; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Tobacco","belimumab; hydroxychloroquine; cigarette smoking; current smoker; disease activity; drug efficacy; ex-smoker; human; meta analysis; never smoker; questionnaire; Review; risk factor; skin defect; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment response; case control study; cohort analysis; smoking; systemic lupus erythematosus; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Risk Factors; Tobacco Smoking","Arnaud, L.; Service de rhumatologie, Centre National de Référence des Maladies Autoimmunes et Systémiques Rares, Hôpital de Hautepierre, 1 Avenue Molière BP 83049, France; email: laurent.arnaud@chru-strasbourg.fr",,"Elsevier B.V.",15689972,,ARUEB,"31520802","English","Autoimmun.

Although video-based assessment is becoming more common in surgical training, a broad understanding of its utility is lacking. This scoping review explores video-based assessment in surgical training and presents the evidence supporting its use. Design: A literature search was conducted using the Web of Science database with key words related to video-based assessment and surgical training. Exclusion criteria included articles not published in English and articles on undergraduate medical education, continuing professional development, or non-surgical disciplines. Initially, 702 articles were identified; after title, abstract, and full-text screening by two independent reviewers (SM and VM), 199 articles remained. Results: We present the benefits of video-based assessment, including the ability to capture clinical ability in the operating room without decreasing intraoperative efficiency, as well as the potential to improve formative assessment and feedback practices. We describe the validity, reliability, and challenges of video-based assessment, as well as the use of video-based methods in clinical and simulated settings. We conclude by discussing questions that remain to be addressed. Conclusions: Although further research and cost-benefit analyses are required, greater adoption of video-based assessment into surgical training may help meet increased assessment demands in an era of competency-based medical education. © 2019 Association of Program Directors in Surgery","competency-based medical education; feedback; Interpersonal and Communication Skills; Medical Knowledge; Patient Care; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; Professionalism; surgical education; Video-based assessment","Article; continuing education; human; intraoperative period; medical education; practice guideline; priority journal; professional development; reliability; simulation; surgical training; systematic review; validity; videorecording","Sonnadara, R.; Department of Surgery, McMaster University, A.

A lack of data specific to Indigenous peoples means that new therapeutic methods, such as those involving electronic health (eHealth), will be extrapolated to these groups based on research with other populations. Rigorous, ethical research can be undertaken in collaboration with Indigenous communities but requires careful attention to culturally safe research practices. Literature on how to involve Indigenous peoples in the development and evaluation of eHealth or mobile health apps that responds to the needs of Indigenous patients, providers, and communities is still scarce; however, the need for community-based participatory research to develop culturally safe technologies is emerging as an essential focus in Indigenous eHealth research. To be effective, researchers must first gain an in-depth understanding of Indigenous determinants of health, including the harmful consequences of colonialism. Second, researchers need to learn how colonialism affects the research process. The challenge then for eHealth researchers is to braid Indigenous ethical values with the requirements of good research methodologies into a culturally safe research protocol. Objective: A recent systematic review showed that Indigenous peoples are underrepresented in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), primarily due to a lack of attention to providing space for Indigenous perspectives within the study frameworks of RCTs. Given the lack of guidelines for conducting RCTs with Indigenous communities, we conducted an analysis of our large evaluation data set collected in the Diagnosing Hypertension-Engaging Action and Management in Getting Lower Blood Pressure in Indigenous Peoples and Low- and Middle- Income Countries (DREAM-GLOBAL) trial over a period of five years. Our goal is to identify wise practices for culturally safe, collaborative eHealth and RCT research with Indigenous communities. Methods: We thematically analyzed survey responses and qualitative interview/focus group data that we collected over five years in six culturally diverse Indigenous communities in Canada during the evaluation of the clinical trial DREAM-GLOBAL. We established themes that reflect culturally safe approaches to research and then developed wise practices for culturally safe research in pragmatic eHealth research. Results: Based on our analysis, successful eHealth research in collaboration with Indigenous communities requires a focus on cultural safety that includes: (1) building a respectful relationship; (2) maintaining a respectful relationship; (3) good communication and support for the local team during the RCT; (4) commitment to co-designing the innovation; (5) supporting task shifting with the local team; and (6) reflecting on our mistakes and lessons learned or areas for improvement that support learning and cultural safety. Conclusions: Based on evaluation data collected in the DREAM-GLOBAL RCT, we found that there are important cultural safety considerations in Indigenous eHealth research. Building on the perspectives of Indigenous staff and patients, we gleaned wise practices for RCTs in Indigenous communities. © Marion A Andrea Maar, Valerie Beaudin, Karen Yeates, Lisa Boesch, Peter Liu, Kian Madjedi, Nancy Perkins, Diane Hua-Stewart, Faith Beaudin, Mary Jo Wabano, Sheldon W Tobe.","Community-based participatory research; DREAM-GLOBAL; Health care texting; Hypertension; Implementation science; Indigenous peoples; Mobile health; Process evaluation; SMS; Task shifting","clinical trial (topic); controlled study; electronic health record; human; population group; randomized controlled trial; Clinical Trials as Topic; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Indigenous Peoples; Population Groups","Maar, M.A.; Faculty of Medicine, Northern Ontario School of Medicine, Laurentian University, 935 Ramsey Lake Rd, Canada; email: mmaar@nosm.ca",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,"31682574","English","J.

One way of thinking about a LD system is as a workflow mechanism for collaborative activities, and a specific learning design is similar to a recipe, however, educational and for teachers - describes ingredients (content) and instructions (process). The aim of this article is to outline the state-of-the-art in Learning Design, covering the period from 2001 to 2018. We analyzed the quality, coverage of topics, research methodologies adopted and the potential impact of LD. We carried out manual and automatic research for Systematic Literature Review (SLR) published in journals and conference proceedings. We investigated the relevant studies, compared and integrated our results with the two previous higher education studies. Therefore, 67 articles were identified, which we classified in two main areas of research: a) The use of the specification and its standards; b) The development of systems of authorship, management and execution of LD. From these 67, only 8 achieved the minimum quality requirements established and were considered relevant for the scenario of this research. Finally, our results allow us to see that the SLR as a research method has been less adopt in the LD research community. Additionally, most SLRs did not assess the quality of primary studies, thus restricting their potential impact on educational practice. © 2019 ACM.","Learning design; Learning experience design; Lesson planning; Teaching practice","Ecosystems; Research and development management; Collaborative activities; Learning designs; Learning experiences; Quality requirements; Research methodologies; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Teaching practices; Learning systems",,"Conde-Gonzalez M.A.Rodriguez-Sedano F.J.Fernandez-Llamas C.Garcia-Penalvo F.J.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450371919,,,"English","ACM Int.

With growing media sensationalism and an oversimplification of the phenomenon of over-tourism, its academic theorization has become extremely important. Using Macau, a Special Administrative Region of China as a case in point, the purpose of this paper is to theoretically explore the nexus between over-tourism and sustainable consumption in cities, highlighting governments’ inevitable role in this successful convergence. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a selective systematic literature review (SLR) of existing studies in the form of both news material and academic journals. It investigates the growing concern of over-tourism and the contribution of sustainable consumption grounded in strong political support. It also adopts a case study approach with specific reference to Macau. Findings: The general overview of the literature provides evidence of an age-old concept that has re-emerged to make local residents’ voice more pronounced. Generally, the studies concentrate on understanding residents’ attitudes, the perceived impact of over-tourism, community resilience and sustainable strategies to tackle the problem. Most popular studies are recent (i.e. 2018 and beyond) and empirically set in developed cities of Europe. Research limitations/implications: The SLR used in the current study requires further empirical testing to validate some of the proposed concepts in the literature. Practical implications: The study highlights the role of government in ensuring that sustainable consumption is sustainably implemented in the context of over-tourism. Originality/value: Given the re-emergence of over-tourism, yet with few theoretical discussions on the concept, this study serves as a knowledge-base for future studies both empirically and theoretically. © 2019, International Tourism Studies Association.","Over-tourism; Politics; Sharing economy; Sustainable consumption",,"Agyeiwaah, E.; Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism Management, Macau University of Science and TechnologyChina; email: agyeiwaahelizabeth@yahoo.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20565607,,,,"English","Int.

One such problem is identifying and classifying software requirements on Stack Overflow (SO). The suitability of ML-based techniques to this tackle problem has shown convincing results, much better than those generated by some traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Nevertheless, a comprehensive and systematic comprehension of these ML based techniques is still deficient. Objective: To identify and classify the type of ML algorithms used for identifying software requirements on SO. Method: This article reports systematic literature review (SLR) gathering evidence published up to August, 2019. Results: This study identified 1073 published papers related to RE and SO. Only 12 primary papers were selected. The data extraction process revealed that; 1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling is the most widely used ML algorithm in the selected studies, and 2) Precision and recall are the most commonly used evaluation method to measure the performance of these ML algorithms. Conclusion: The SLR finds that while ML algorithms have great potential in the identification of RE on SO, they face some open issues that will ultimately affect their performance and practical application. The SLR calls for the collaboration between RE and ML researchers, to tackle the open issues facing the development of real-world ML systems. © 2019 IEEE.","Algorithms; Machine learning; Requirements engineering; Stack overflow; Systematic literature review","Algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; Statistics; Empirical evaluations; Latent dirichlet allocations; NAtural language processing; Precision and recall; Software requirements; Stack overflow; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Learning algorithms",,"Li W.Babu M.S.P.","IEEE Computer Society",23270586,9781728109459,,,"English","Proc.IEEE Int.

These are the underlying network for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), a set of applications and services that aim to provide greater security and comfort to drivers and passengers. However, the characteristics and size of a VANET make it a security challenge. It has been a subject of study, with several research works aimed at this problem, usually involving cryptography. There are, however, some attacks that cannot be solved using traditional methodologies. For example, Sybil attack, Denial of Service (DoS), Black Hole, etc. are not preventable using cryptographic tools.

Clinical trials published in English from January 1991 to June 2016 were identified by searching the PubMed (Medline), Cochrane, and Embase databases.Results:Eighteen studies (21 arms; N=810) were identified and used for this meta-analysis. For all treatments included in these studies, the pooled ORR was 0.36 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.30-0.42). The ORR for the carboplatin+gemcitabine arms (6 arms; N=259), which is the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's recommended first-line treatment (before approval of atezolizumab and pembrolizumab) for this population was 0.36 (95% CI, 0.30-0.42), the median DOR (4 arms) was 7.00 months (95% CI, 4.34-11.29), and the median OS was 8.39 months (95% CI, 7.05-9.98).Conclusions:The results of this SLR clearly demonstrate the paucity of clinical studies that assess therapeutic intervention in truly cisplatin-ineligible advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma subjects and highlight the development of novel therapies that can create real improvement in long-term outcomes. The recent approval of 2 checkpoint inhibitors, atezolizumab and pembrolizumab, were added in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidance as recommended first-line treatment for cisplatin-ineligible patients with advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma and has provided alternatives for this patient population. © 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The review has selected a total of 75 primary studies after the careful filtering of inclusion/exclusion and quality assessment criteria. The performed analysis reveals that artificial neural network (ANN) as ML model, NASA as dataset, and mean magnitude of relative error (MMRE) as accuracy measure are widely used in the selected studies. ANN and support vector machine (SVM) are the two techniques which have outperformed other ML techniques in more studies. Regression techniques are the mostly used among the non-ML techniques, which outperformed other ML techniques in about 19 studies.

Protocols that use several metrics have been shown to be the most adequate to VANETs due to their effectiveness in dealing with dynamic environment changes due to vehicle mobility. Metrics such as distance, density, link stability, speed, and position were selected by the authors for the best proposal. Several surveys of routing proposals have been generated to categorize contributions and their application scenarios, but none of them focused on multimetric approaches. In this paper, we present a review of the routing protocols based on more than one metric to select the best route in a VANET. The main objective of this research was to present the contemporary most frequently used metrics in the different proposals and their application scenarios. This review helps in the selection protocols or the creation of metrics when a new protocol is designed.This survey of multimetric VANET routing protocols employed systematic literature-review (SLR) methodology in four well-knownown databases that allowed to analyze current state-of-the-art proposals. In addition, this paper provides a description of these multimetric routing protocols. Our findings indicate that distance and speed are the most popular and versatile metrics. Finally, we define some possible directions for future research related to the use of this class of protocols. © 2019 by the authors.

One of the most crucial aspects of developing games lies in modeling and predicting individual behavior, the study of computational models of players in games. Although model-based approaches have been considered standard for this purpose, their application is often extremely difficult due to the huge space of actions that can be created by educational games. For this reason, data-driven approaches have shown promise, in part because they are not completely reliant on expert knowledge. This study seeks to systematically review the existing research on the use of data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games. The primary objectives of this study are to identify, classify, and bring together the relevant approaches. We have carefully surveyed a 10-year sample (2008–2017) of research studies conducted on data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, and thereby found 67 significant research works. However, our criteria for inclusion reduced the sample to 21 studies that addressed four primary research questions, and so we analyzed and classified the questions, methods, and findings of these published works, which we evaluated and from which we drew conclusions based on non-statistical methods. We found that there are three primary avenues along which data-driven approaches have been studied in educational games research: first, the objective of data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, namely behavior modeling, goal recognition, and procedural content generation; second, approaches employed in such modeling; finally, current challenges of using data-driven approaches in player modeling of educational games, namely game data, temporal forecasting in player models, statistical techniques, algorithmic efficiency, knowledge engineering, problem of generalizability, and data sparsity problem. In conclusion we addressed four critical future challenges in the area, namely, the lack of proper and rich data publicly available to the researchers, the lack of a data-driven method to identify conceptual features from log data, hybrid player modeling approaches, and data mining techniques for individual prediction. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Data-driven approach; Educational games; Player modeling; Systematic literature review (SLR); User modeling","Forecasting; Data-driven approach; Educational game; Player modeling; Systematic literature review (SLR); User Modeling; Data mining","Lim, H.; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Korea UniversitySouth Korea; email: limhseok@korea.ac.kr",,"Springer Netherlands",02692821,,AIRVE,,"English","Artif Intell Rev",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039702872

Many articles have been published with regards Industry 4.0; however, there is no research that clearly conceptualizes Industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain. This paper aims to propose the term “Supply Chain 4.0” together with a novel conceptual framework that captures the essence of Industry 4.0 within the supply chain context. As Industry 4.0 is inherently a revolution, and as revolutions are evolutionary, this research also aims to capture the evolution of Supply Chain 4.0 from maturity levels perspective to facilitate the formulation and development of Supply Chain 4.0 strategy. Design/methodology/approach: Following a deductive research approach and a qualitative strategy, a systematic literature review (SLR) was adopted as the research method seeking to understand the relationships among supply chain, Industry 4.0 and maturity levels research. The three phases of the SLR process utilized are: planning, conducting and reporting. A concept-oriented technique was applied to the outputs of the SLR to obtain the key constructs that would facilitate the development of the conceptual Supply Chain 4.0 framework. Findings: The SLR showed that there is limited research linking Industry 4.0 to supply chain. Nevertheless, it was possible to extract a set of thematic categories from the analysis of the articles which are referred to as constructs as they form the core of the conceptual Supply Chain 4.0 framework. These constructs are managerial and capability supporters, technology levers, processes performance requirements and strategic outcomes. Each of these constructs consists of a number of elements which are referred to as “dimensions” in this research and a total of 21 dimensions were identified during the SLR. The SLR also demonstrated that maturity propositions for Industry 4.0 are still embrionary and entirely missing in the context of supply chain. Hence, this research develops and proposes a maturity levels framework that is underpinned by the core constructs of Supply Chain 4.0 and the corresponding dimensions. As these proposed frameworks are conceptual, this research also identifies and proposes several research directions to help fortify the Supply Chain 4.0 concept. Research limitations/implications: This research argues that the frameworks are robust because the constructs and dimensions are grounded in the literature, thus demonstrating both theoretical and practical relevance and value. As Supply Chain 4.0 research is still in infancy, there is a range of open research questions suggested based on the frameworks that could serve as guides for researchers to further develop the Supply Chain 4.0 concept. Also, practitioners can use this framework to develop better understanding of Supply Chain 4.0 and be able to evaluate the maturity of their organizations. As the proposed frameworks are conceptual, they require further empirical research to validate them and obtain new insights. Originality/value: The SLR demonstrated a clear gap in literature with regards to Industry 4.0 in the context of supply chain, and also in the context of Industry 4.0 maturity levels for supply chain. This research is unique as it formulates and introduces novel frameworks that close these gaps in literature. The value of this research lies in the fact that it makes significant contribution in terms of understanding of Supply Chain 4.0 with a clear set of constructs and dimensions that form Supply Chain 4.0, which provides the foundation for further work in this area. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Research; SCM framework; Systematic literature review",,"Kumar, V.; Bristol Business School, University of the West of EnglandUnited Kingdom; email: vikas.kumar@uwe.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13598546,,,,"English","Supply Chain Manage.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073987977

Design/methodology/approach: The paper adopts systematic literature review (SLR) approach to observe and understand trends and extant patterns/themes in the big data analytics (BDA) research area particularly in construction-specific literature. Findings: A significant rise in construction big data research is identified with an increasing trend in number of yearly articles. The main themes discussed were big data as a concept, big data analytical methods/techniques, big data opportunities – challenges and big data application. The paper emphasises “the implication of big data in to overall sustainability” as a gap that needs to be addressed. These implications are categorised as social, economic and environmental aspects. Research limitations/implications: The SLR is carried out for construction technology and management research for the time period of 2007–2017 in Scopus and emerald databases only. Practical implications: The paper enables practitioners to explore the key themes discussed around big data research as well as the practical applicability of big data techniques. The advances in existing big data research inform practitioners the current social, economic and environmental implications of big data which would ultimately help them to incorporate into their strategies to pursue competitive advantage. Identification of knowledge gaps helps keep the academic research move forward for a continuously evolving body of knowledge. The suggested new research avenues will inform future researchers for potential trending and untouched areas for research. Social implications: Identification of knowledge gaps helps keep the academic research move forward for continuous improvement while learning. The continuously evolving body of knowledge is an asset to the society in terms of revealing the truth about emerging technologies. Originality/value: There is currently no comprehensive review that addresses social, economic and environmental implications of big data in construction literature.

The areas of climate change, biodiversity loss, nitrogen cycle and land use have left the so called safe operating space for humanity. The built environment is one of the major contributors to environmental impacts. Especially the embodied energy during the construction phase of the built environment and the energy demands during the use of buildings contribute to a high energy and resource consumption. In the year 2015 the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a universal development agenda, which goals need to be fulfilled by the year 2030 and by all UN countries worldwide. Amongst other countries Austria has adopted the 2030 agenda and has committed itself to the SDGs. Research objective was to explore the application of systemic approaches in the field of SDGs. The work presents a systematic literature review (SLR) and discusses an application of a qualitative system analysis (carried out with the tool iMODELER) on the SDGs. Results show how interdependencies among SDGs and among chosen concrete actions, e.g. for the built environment, can be visualized for a better systemic understanding.

Most of the debate on grammar teaching focused on the rationales for teaching it, rather than on the linguistic content that should be taught. At the same time, there appears to be a renewed interest in restoring the bond between linguistic theory and grammar education. Previous research has suggested that it would be highly desirable to gain a clearer picture of this content. Which concepts are being discussed in the literature on grammar education, and to what extent are these compatible with modern linguistics, in other words: is the literature on grammar teaching up-to-date? This systematic literature review is the first to dive into these questions. Results indicate: (1) most of the concepts in the literature on grammar teaching are from traditional grammar. To a limited extent, there are also concepts from modern linguistic theory that are being discussed, but mostly implicitly; (2) most concepts are not being motivated because they are meaningful in modern theoretical linguistics, but because they reflect traditional classroom practices and policy. It can consequently be concluded that education on linguistic analysis is not up-to-date, which potentially has severe consequences: implementing insights from modern linguistics is likely to provide students with deeper insights, and teachers with a better equipped pedagogy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","educational linguistics; Grammar teaching; linguistic concepts; secondary education; syntax; Systematic Literature Review (SLR); theoretical linguistics",,"van Rijt, J.; Department of Teacher Education, Fontys University of Applied SciencesNetherlands; email: j.vanrijt@fontys.nl",,"Routledge",02671522,,,,"English","Res.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review was conducted using 70 articles published between the years of 2006 and 2017, which were subjected to descriptive and thematic analysis. Findings: The descriptive analysis established that the RLSC concept was dealt within the majority of the publications (61 per cent), followed by concepts related to quality in RLSC (24 per cent). Only 14 per cent of the articles were based on IM concepts related to RLSC. Quality and information are interrelated in the effective implementation of RLSC. The thematic analysis demonstrated that there is a need for using quality parameters in a regulatory environment in an information-based environment. Based on the findings, future research directions were developed. Research limitations/implications: The study encourages researchers to identify novel directions by combining these three concepts. The study developed a future research agenda regarding use of building information modelling (BIM) for existing buildings under novel technologies; analysis of secondary market demand and supply; and assessment of cost and safety management with quality in a BIM-enabled environment. Practical implications: The practical implications include the application of sustainable management principles based on stakeholders and the regulatory environment.

The purpose of this study is twofold: to highlight the strategic approaches followed in recent contributions in the field of finance connected to the main approaches of the pioneering authors (Graham and Dodd, 1934; Fisher, 1958; Fama and French, 1992; Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny, 1994) who have investigated VI; and to analyse whether scholars follow a qualitative approach in studying VI that enables companies to achieve greater competitive advantage. Design/methodology/approach: From a SLR of peer-reviewed papers covering the period 2007-2017, 45 papers were identified and analysed to present a better understanding of the adopted approaches and methodologies compared to the pioneering contributions on the topic. Findings: This search found that 24 out of 45 papers specifically analyse VI. In particular, this work highlights 20 out of 24 papers that directly or indirectly, follow the approaches of “Graham and Dodd” or “Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny”/“Fama and French”, and 4 out of 24 that do not follow one of the main approaches identified. After the descriptive findings of the review, this paper highlights that none of the contributions takes into account qualitative analysis of a company to define whether the firm itself does or does not have a sustainable competitive advantage. Practical implications: This paper suggests to international investors who intend to invest in one or more markets to revise the basic principles of VI, while also considering qualitative elements related to strategic aspects and behavioural finance. In particular, this study suggests that the investor introduce a qualitative analysis to allocate equity in value firms with a lasting competitive advantage. Originality/value: This study contributes to advance the knowledge of VI from a theoretical point of view. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first study that systematises the international literature on this topic by highlighting the main contributions written in the period 2007-2017, analysing the development of the pioneering strategic approaches and examining their method of assessing firms. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Capital allocation; Corporate finance; International investors; International studies; Lasting competitive advantage; Strategic approaches; Systematic literature review; Value investing",,"Battisti, E.; Department of Management, Università degli Studi di TorinoItaly; email: enrico.battisti@unito.it",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20596014,,,,"English","Rev.

One of the sources of GL refers to content produced by professionals based on their practical experiences? Recent researches in the SE states that GL can complement areas of research that are not yet clearly defined in the scientific literature. In this context, the Multivocal Literature Review (MLR), a form of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with the inclusion of GL, emerges. Goal: Provide preliminary work about the current research involving MLR studies? First, we investigate the motivation of the researchers to include GL in review studies; and second, we examine how GL was included in the studies. Method: A tertiary study was conducted to search MLR studies published between 2009 to April of 2019. Results: The main motivations for including GL in review studies are: lack of academic research on the topic, emerging research on this topic, and complementary evidence in the GL? Internet articles and white papers were the main sources of GL data used. Conclusions: The conducting of MLR studies is still in its early stages; we have identified only 12 secondary studies. The MLR studies were conducted using guidelines for performing SLRs.

This has motivated a lot of research focused on automating the process. Current state-of-the-art methods combine active learning methods and manual selection of primary studies from a smaller set so they can maximize the finding of relevant papers while at the same time minimizing the number of manually reviewed papers. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to further improve these methods whose early success heavily depends on an effective selection of initial papers to be read by researchers using a PCAbased method which combines different document representation and similarity metric approaches to cluster and rank the content within the corpus related to an enriched representation of research questions within the SLR protocol. Validation was carried out over four publicly available data sets corresponding to SLR studies from the Software Engineering domain. The proposed model proved to be more efficient than a BM25 baseline model as a mechanism to select the initial set of relevant primary studies within the top 100 rank, which makes it a promising method to bootstrap an active learning cycle. © 2019 IEEE.","automation; data mining; knowledge graphs; machinelearning; NLP; PCA; ranking indexing; Systematic literature review; text mining",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728155746,,,"English","Proc. - Lat.

The search strategy retrieved a total of 50 multi-source empirical studies on the topic of EL, published until December 2017. This SLR shows that (a) research on EL has focused mostly on the perceptions of followers, possibly because they are the most accessible target of its outcomes, thus restricting the scope of this body of research; (b) EL is studied mainly through consideration of its consequences, a restriction that hinders explanation of the causal processes involved in ethical leadership, which remains a research arena in need of development.

However, generic tools to measure the performance of sustainability objectives and initiatives are scarce. Traditional project performance measurement uses the Earned Value Management (EVM) method to measure time, cost and scope. The objective of this paper is to investigate whether EVM can be adapted to measure the performance of sustainability goals in projects. By means of two Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR), this paper investigates the bodies of knowledge of ‘sustainability in Project Management’ and ‘Earned Value Management’. A total of 2.232 publications from 6 databases from both fields were identified through the two SLM and analysed via two-stage screening process. The review found that the project control method EVM has not yet been used to track the performance of sustainability in projects. We therefore developed the conceptual framework for ‘Earned Green Value Management’. Thus concluding, by incorporating sustainability in the business case (instead of scope), extending monitoring into the product life cycle, addressing the triple bottom line, and translating generic sustainability indicators into monetary terms to express value created through improved resource performance (instead of expenses), EVM can be translated and applied to the measurement of project sustainability and performance. The conceptual framework presented herein lays the theoretical groundwork for a new project management tool to track the attainment of sustainability goals in projects. It contributes to the current research in sustainable project management by bridging a gap between traditional tools and normative topics on an operational level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Earned Green Value Management; Earned value management; Project control; Project management; Sustainable project management","Budget control; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Value engineering; Earned value management; Project control; Project sustainability; Sustainability indicators; Sustainability objectives; Sustainable project managements; Systematic literature review (SLR); Value management; Project management","Moehler, R.C.; Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Monash University, 23 College Walk, Clayton Campus, Australia; email: robert.moehler@monash.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Methods An SLR was performed according to the standard operating procedures for EULAR-endorsed recommendations. Outcome was determined by efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of vaccination in adult patients with AIIRD, including those receiving immunomodulating therapy. Furthermore, a search was performed on the effect of vaccinating household members of patients with AIIRD on the occurrence of vaccine-preventable infections in patients and their household members (including newborns). The literature search was performed using Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library (October 2009 to August 2018). Results While most investigated vaccines were efficacious and/or immunogenic in patients with AIIRD, some were less efficacious than in healthy control subjects, and/or in patients receiving immunosuppressive agents. Adverse events of vaccination were generally mild and the rates were comparable to those in healthy persons. Vaccination did not seem to lead to an increase in activity of the underlying AIIRD, but insufficient power of most studies precluded arriving at definite conclusions. The number of studies investigating clinical efficacy of vaccination is still limited. No studies on the effect of vaccinating household members of patients with AIIRD were retrieved. Conclusion Evidence on efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of vaccination in patients with AIIRD was systematically reviewed to provide a basis for updated recommendations. © 2019 Author(s).","autoimmune diseases; infections; vaccination","hepatitis A vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; immunomodulating agent; influenza vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; tetanus toxoid; tick borne encephalitis vaccine; vaccine; varicella zoster vaccine; Wart virus vaccine; yellow fever vaccine; Cochrane Library; drug efficacy; drug safety; Embase; hepatitis A; hepatitis B; herpes zoster; human; influenza vaccination; Medline; meta analysis; pandemic influenza; papillomavirus infection; pneumococcal infection; randomized controlled trial; Review; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; tetanus; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; Wegener granulomatosis; yellow fever","Rondaan, C.; Medical Microbiology and Infection Prevention, UMCGNetherlands; email: c.rondaan@umcg.nl",,"BMJ Publishing Group",20565933,,,,"English","RMD Open",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072164098

Methods: Two systematic literature reviews (SLRs) dealing with diagnosis/monitoring and treatment strategies for LVV, respectively, were performed. Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched from inception to 31 December 2017. Evidence on imaging was excluded as recently published in dedicated EULAR recommendations. This paper focuses on the data relevant to giant cell arteritis (GCA). Results: We identified 287 eligible articles (122 studies focused on diagnosis/monitoring, 165 on treatment). The implementation of a fast-track approach to diagnosis significantly lowers the risk of permanent visual loss compared with historical cohorts (level of evidence, LoE 2b). Reliable diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers for GCA are still not available (LoE 3b). The SLR confirms the efficacy of prompt initiation of glucocorticoids (GC). There is no high-quality evidence on the most appropriate starting dose, route of administration, tapering and duration of GC (LoE 4). Patients with GCA are at increased risk of dose-dependent GC-related adverse events (LoE 3b). The addition of methotrexate or tocilizumab reduces relapse rates and GC requirements (LoE 1b). There is no consistent evidence that initiating antiplatelet agents at diagnosis would prevent future ischaemic events (LoE 2a). There is little evidence to guide monitoring of patients with GCA. Conclusions: Results from two SLRs identified novel evidence on the management of GCA to guide the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendations on the management of LVV. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.",,"antithrombocytic agent; biological marker; glucocorticoid; immunosuppressive agent; methotrexate; tocilizumab; Article; cataract; cerebrovascular accident; claudication; clinical assessment; Cochrane Library; comorbidity; disease activity; Embase; follow up; giant cell arteritis; glaucoma; headache; human; ischemia; large vessel vasculitis; Medline; patient-reported outcome; physiotherapy; recurrence risk; revascularization; systematic review; vasculitis; visual impairment","Monti, S.; Rheumatology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San MatteoItaly; email: sara.saramonti@gmail.com",,"BMJ Publishing Group",20565933,,,,"English","RMD Open",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068591312

At present the community must pay for the cost of rubbish, whereas rubbish can be useful and profitable if managed properly. One way to manage waste properly is to save waste at the Trash Bank. At present there are already several garbage banks established, but the garbage banks that have been run are not yet optimal, not all people use these facilities. Lack of knowledge and infrastructure facilities hamper the waste management process at the garbage bank. Therefore, the authors propose the concept of an integrated system based on service oriented architecture (SOA) to integrate garbage pickup services, banks, garbage banks, cooperatives, gas, electricity, cable tv, public relations, e-commerce and health insurance as a means of supporting infrastructure to support waste management. The method in this study uses Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The results of this study are in the form of a waste management application design: Go-Waste which integrates waste pick-up service, banks, garbage banks, cooperatives, gas, electricity, cable tv, public relations, e-commerce and health insurance in one platform using a service oriented architecture (SOA). © BEIESP.","Garbage bank; Service-oriented architecture (SOA); Waste management service information system",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",22773878,,,,"English","Int.

It is a machinery of executing policies and programs. Apart from this crucial function, it also provides services through the Ministries, Department, and Agencies. Many decades ago, the said services were inadequate in terms of how they are delivering. However, to further toughen its determination in implementing the federal government national development plan in the country. Office of the head of service of the federation has taken a critical look at its performance towards building and developing the capacity for civil servants and effort to create employment through various entrepreneurial and skill acquisition programmes. The primary objective of this paper is to scrutinise the myth and reality of the restructuring of public service in Nigeria. The study used a systematic literature review (SLR) as a methodology, the author searched document from the journal database, i.e. google scholar and library catalogue using different terms and synonyms, relevant articles found and critically review. The screening has conducted which exclude predatory papers because of the low quality of the journal.

It seeks to investigate the beliefs of academic staff regarding the use of ICT and other factors to enhance the productivity of their scientific research. Also, this study aims to improve the sustainability of publication in Saudi universities. ICT includes using the library system for accessing research repository databases such as Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, etc. and other factors. The authors also developed the Importance Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) for these factors in order to provide guidelines for Saudi universities to build university systems to manage and measure the research productivity of academic staff. In summary, this research identifies factors critical to enhancing research productivity in Saudi universities. This will help to improve the sustainability of publication in Saudi universities. By enhancing the sustainability of publication, the reputation of Saudi universities will be improved and the reputation of academic staff in Saudi universities. As well the sustainability of publication will assist the promote of Saudi academic staff. Approach: This paper analysed 200 papers related to the enhancement of research productivity from various research databases such as Science Direct, IEEE and Scopus. We included the usage of ICT in research analysis, university policy, university research funding and the number of publications published by academic staff. The authors used different databases and systematic literature reviews (SLR) to find the most important factors which could improve research productivity in universities. An online questionnaire answered by 375 academic staff from four developing Saudi universities that are Taif University, Taibah University, Jeddah University, Hail University�was used to determine the relationship between information technology factors and research performance together with other factors such as university policy, international collaboration, research funding and job satisfaction. In this study, we used SmartPLS v3 to analyse the results from the questionnaires. Findings: The results show that personal factors such as personal use of ICT and organisational factors such as job satisfaction, university policy, IT funding, international collaboration and the level of ICT use in the university have positive effects on scientific research productivity among academic staff at Saudi universities. Those results are based on the beliefs of academic staff regarding the use of information technology for research purposes and other factors. This paper finds that university policy recorded an importance of 0.523, job satisfaction was 0.224, international collaboration was 0.103, personal use of ICT was 0.102, the level of using ICT in the university was 0.074 and the importance of ICT funding was �0.156. Also, the results from SmartPLS show that university policy has a 0.215 effect size on research performance, job satisfaction has a 0.045 effect size on research performance, international collaboration has a 0.009 effect size on research performance, personal use of ICT has a 0.011 effect size on research performance, a university�s use of ICT has a 0.006 effect size on research performance and ICT funding has a 0.014 effect size on the research performance of academic staff in Saudi universities. These results will help to improve the sustainability of publication in Saudi universities in order to enhance the universities� rankings and the reputation of academic staff. Sustainability is a target for any organization, both for profit-making entities or non-profit organizations such as universities. This means that Saudi universities should enhance the sustainability of their publication. In order to achieves the goals of higher education institutions. Originality: No study has investigated the factors affecting the performance of academic staff in Arab countries, especially in Saudi universities. Therefore, the originality of this study resides in being the first study to investigate the impact of researchers� attitudes to enhancing the research productivity performance of researchers in Saudi universities. Also, it is one of the few studies which discusses sustainability in Saudi universities. © 2019 by the authors.","Biometric analysis; ICT; International collaboration; Job satisfaction; Policy; Research productivity; Saudi universities; Scientometric analysis; Sustainability in management; Sustainable leadership; Systematic review","Scopus","Selamat, A.; Media and Games Center of Excellence (MagicX), Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: aselamat@utm.my",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071978981

It also examines if lean management (LM) and supply management (SM) are antecedents of SSCM. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review of literature was undertaken across multiple streams, including operations management, SCM, sustainability, business ethics and performance management. Articles relevant to SSCM published over a span of 31 years (1988–2018) were searched using keywords and specific selection criteria. Findings: From the literature, three dependent constructs – motivators of sustainability, LM and SM – and three independent constructs – environmental practices in SCM, social practices in SCM and SSCM performance – are identified and defined. Linkages between these constructs are hypothesized to develop a theoretical framework called the “integrated lean/supply management with sustainability motivators, practices and performance model.” Research limitations/implications: Built on the principles-practices-outcomes framework proposed earlier, this model is comprehensive in its coverage of sustainability antecedents, practices and performance. Further, it covers the SCM triad – the supplier, the focal firm and the customers – as well as the roles they play in sustainability performance. Originality/value: By identifying LM and SM as additional antecedents of SSCM, this study suggests that sustainability may be realized through LM and SM principles. Further, the proposed model presents a novel integration of literature from diverse domains. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Environmental supply chain practices; Lean management; Performance measures",,"Raut, R.; Department of Operations and Supply Chain Management, National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE)India; email: rakeshraut09@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14635771,,BQMTF,,"English","Benchmarking",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071642593

Accordingly, firms had to adjust their logistics and supply chain management (SCM) processes from fulfilling orders for each channel separately to integrating channels on the back-end (omnichannel fulfillment). This development is mirrored by an emerging stream of academic publications. The purpose of this paper is to provide a snapshot of the current state of omnichannel fulfillment research via a systematic literature review (SLR) in order to identify omnichannel fulfillment strategies and to establish an agenda for future inquiry. Design/methodology/approach: This SLR is based on 104 papers published in peer-reviewed journals through December 2018. It employs a six-step process, from research question to the presentation of the insights. Findings: All selected manuscripts are categorized based on demographics such as publication date, outlet, methodology, etc. Analysis of the manuscripts suggests that the integration of fulfillment channel inventory and resources is becoming an important objective of fulfillment management. Appropriate omnichannel strategies based on retailer attributes are not well understood. Industry specific research has been conducted necessitating generalized extension for retailers. These findings provide a clear opportunity for the academic community to take more of the lead in terms of knowledge creation by proposing paths for industry pursuit of channel integration to successfully implement omnichannel fulfillment. Opportunities for future inquiry are highlighted. Originality/value: This manuscript proposes a definition of omnichannel fulfillment strategies and identifies fulfillment links that are used interchangeably across channels as the key delimiter between omnichannel fulfillment strategies and related concepts. Six omnichannel fulfillment strategies from the extant literature are identified and conceptualized. Future research opportunities around omnichannel fulfillment, potential interdependencies between the established strategies and their impact on related SCM issues such as distribution and reverse logistics are detailed. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Literature review; North America; Omnichannel; Retail logistics; Supply chain processes",,"Taylor, D.; Department of Marketing and Supply Chain Management, Texas Tech UniversityUnited States; email: daniel.taylor@ttu.edu",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09574093,,,,"English","Int.

Additionally, to determine the feasibility of conducting a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) to validate the meta-regression results. Methods: A published systematic literature review (SLR) identified studies evaluating the efficacy of cladribine tablets and alternative DMTs in the management of active RRMS. A series of meta-regression models were run with adjustment for baseline risk, fitted to data from the intention-to-treat cohorts of trials identified in the SLR. A non-parametric MAIC analysis adjusted for differences between studies by reweighting patient-level data from the index trial to match the mean baseline characteristics reported for trials with only aggregate data. Results: The meta-regression analysis showed significant overlap in credible intervals for the hazard ratios of 6 month confirmed disability progression (CDP-6M) and annualized relapse rate (ARR), with no therapy statistically dominating in terms of efficacy and all therapies estimated to reduce the ARR compared to placebo in all subpopulations. In the MAIC analysis, cladribine tablets showed a reduction in CDP-6M and ARR comparable to alemtuzumab before and after matching. Conclusion: This analysis has demonstrated that cladribine tablets have comparable relative efficacy to other highly efficacious DMTs in active RRMS across all subpopulations, thus validating the comparative effectiveness results from previous network meta-analysis. The MAIC analysis showed that cladribine tablets are comparable in efficacy to alemtuzumab in the treatment of patients with RRMS. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cladribine; disease modifying therapy; indirect treatment comparison; matching-adjusted indirect comparison; meta-regression; Relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis","alemtuzumab; cladribine; fingolimod; natalizumab; ocrelizumab; placebo; cladribine; fingolimod; immunosuppressive agent; Article; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; disability; drug efficacy; feasibility study; human; meta analysis; multiple sclerosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrence risk; systematic review; tablet; disease exacerbation; multiple sclerosis; tablet; treatment outcome; Cladribine; Disease Progression; Fingolimod Hydrochloride; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting; Tablets; Treatment Outcome","Harty, G.; EMD Serono Research and Development Institute, Inc., 45A Middlesex Turnpike, United States; email: gerard.harty@emdserono.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",03007995,,CMROC,"30786783","English","Curr.

Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) identified randomized controlled trials of AEDs treating focal (partial-onset) seizures for ≥8 weeks and assessed them for inclusion in the NMA. Bayesian random-effects NMA was performed for several outcomes. All interventions within the licensed dose range were included in the network of evidence. Results: The SLR identified 82 studies; 65 were included in the NMA. These studies had baseline mean age 33.1–38.0 years, mean duration of epilepsy 18.7–23.0 years and median seizure frequency/28 days 8.1–11.8. All AEDs had significantly higher odds than placebo of achieving ≥50% responder rates (odds ratios 1.83–3.58) and all AEDs had a trend of higher odds than placebo of achieving seizure freedom (odds ratios 1.36–5.73), most being statistically significant. Tolerability outcomes were comparable between AEDs; most AEDs had higher odds than placebo of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation, serious AEs, nausea, fatigue, dizziness and somnolence. Conclusions: This NMA would appear to show relative equivalence in efficacy, safety and tolerability outcomes of the included AEDs. However, patient heterogeneity within trials and in clinical practice should be considered when interpreting these results. While NMAs are based on the best available evidence the authors suggest that, due to the inability of NMAs to capture unmeasured confounding factors and population heterogeneity, NMAs must not be the sole basis for comparative treatment recommendations. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Anticonvulsant; Bayesian analysis; epilepsy; mixed treatment meta-analysis; network meta-analysis","anticonvulsive agent; brivaracetam; eslicarbazepine; gabapentin; lacosamide; lamotrigine; levetiracetam; oxcarbazepine; perampanel; phenytoin; pregabalin; retigabine; tiagabine; topiramate; zonisamide; 2 pyrrolidone derivative; anticonvulsive agent; brivaracetam; adjuvant therapy; adult; Article; Bayes theorem; clinical outcome; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; fatigue; focal epilepsy; human; meta analysis; nausea; randomized controlled trial (topic); somnolence; systematic review; network meta-analysis; seizure; Adult; Anticonvulsants; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Pyrrolidinones; Seizures","Charokopou, M.; Allée de la Recherche, UCB Pharma, 60, B - 1070, Belgium; email: mata.charokopou@ucb.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",03007995,,CMROC,"30799639","English","Curr.

They are valuable tools to support the quantitative analysis of the behavior of different types of projects because they allow the use of different techniques such as stochastic and analytical methods to evaluate the impact of project decisions without the real execution costs. Recently, in silico studies have been used to study distributed software development projects. In this paper, we present a simulation model defined by a set of variables that describe the dynamics of Distributed Software Development (DSD) projects. The assessment of our simulation model is based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) where we seek evidence, from primary studies published until October 2018, that the variables and relationships in our model do exist in actual DSD projects. We use a SLR as a validation mechanism. Our results are twofold. First, there is a gap of studies on some variables including knowledge expertise and task allocation strategy in distributed software development projects. And, second, there still is a lack of data to support results related to productivity, especially testing activities, on DSD projects. Despite the problem of lack of common terminology for reporting the results on DSD studies, we argue that we need more studies to be able to clearly infer the dynamics of the relationship between variables on distributed software development. Our study brings one step closer to fulfill this gap. © 2019 IEEE.","Distributed Software Development; In Silico Studies; Literature Review; Process Simulation","Application programs; Stochastic systems; Analytical method; Distributed software; Distributed software development; In-silico; Literature reviews; Process simulations; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,"Staron M.Capilla R.Skavhaug A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728132853,,,"English","Proc. - Euromicro Conf.

Especially in elder populations (in 2017, 6.7% of the world’s population was over 65 years of age), these habits could lead to important-nutrient losses that could seriously affect their cognitive and functional state. Recently, a great research effort has been devoted to using different technologies and proposing different techniques for monitoring food-intake. Nevertheless, these techniques are usually generic but make use of the most innovative technologies and methodologies to obtain the best possible monitoring results. However, a large percentage of elderly people live in depopulated rural areas (in Spain, 28.1% of the elderly population lives in this type of area) with a fragile cultural and socioeconomic context. The use of these techniques in these environments is crucial to improving this group’s quality of life (and even reducing their healthcare expenses). At the same time, it is especially challenging since they have very specific and strict requirements regarding the use and application of technology. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we analyze the most important proposed technologies and techniques in order to identify whether they can be applied in this context and if they can be used to improve the quality of life of this fragile collective. In this SLR, we have analyzed 326 papers. From those, 29 proposals have been completely analyzed, taking into account the characteristics and requirements of this population. © 2019 by the authors.

Although increasingly applied, no systematic analysis of PoN applications has yet been performed to assess the theory's efficacy in practice. OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective was to assess the scope and verifiability of PoN applications. METHOD: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of peer-reviewed PoN applications. We analyzed what visual notations have been evaluated and designed using the PoN, for what reasons, to what degree applications consider requirements of their notation's users, and how verifiable these applications are. RESULTS: Seventy PoN applications were analyzed. We found major differences between applications evaluating existing notations and applications designing new notations. Particularly, in the case of new notations, we found that most applications adopted the PoN with little critical thought towards it, rarely considered its suitability for a particular context, and typically treated and discussed the PoN with few, if any, verifiable details and data. CONCLUSION: The results warrant consideration for those applying the PoN to do so carefully, and show the need for additional means to guide designers in systematically applying the PoN. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","cognitive effectiveness; design rationale; physics of notations; Systematic literature review; visual notations","Flow visualization; Physics; Semantics; Unified Modeling Language; cognitive effectiveness; Complexity theory; Design rationale; Physics of notations; Systematic literature review; Visual notations; Visual languages","Van Der Linden, D.; Department of Computer Science, University of BristolUnited Kingdom; email: dirk.vanderlinden@bristol.ac.uk",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00985589,,IESED,,"English","IEEE Trans Software Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041491963

Using molecular biomarkers as an alternative protocol to biopsies, for monitoring rejection may help to mitigate some of these problems, increasing the survival rates and well-being of patients. Recent advances in omics technologies provide an opportunity for screening new molecular biomarkers to identify those with clinical utility. Objective: This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to summarize existing evidence derived from large-scale expression profiling regarding differentially expressed mRNA and miRNA in graft rejection, highlighting potential molecular biomarkers in transplantation. Methods: The study was conducted following PRISMA methodology and the BiSLR guide for performing SLR in bioinformatics. PubMed, ScienceDirect, and EMBASE were searched for publications from January 2001 to January 2018, and studies (i) aiming at the identification of transplant rejection biomarkers, (ii) including human subjects, and (iii) applying methodologies for differential expression analysis from large-scale expression profiling were considered eligible. Differential expression patterns reported for genes and miRNAs in rejection were summarized from both cross-organ and organ-specific perspectives, and pathways enrichment analysis was performed for candidate biomarkers to interrogate their functional role in transplant rejection. Results: A total of 821 references were collected, resulting in 604 studies after removal of duplicates. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 33 studies were included in our analysis. Among the 1517 genes and 174 miRNAs identifed, CXCL9, CXCL10, STAT1, hsa-miR-142-3p, and hsa-miR-155 appeared to be particularly promising as biomarkers in transplantation, with an increased expression associated with transplant rejection in multiple organs. In addition, hsa-miR-28-5p was consistently decreased in samples taken from rejected organs. Conclusion: Despite the need for further research to fill existing knowledge gaps, transcriptomic technologies have a relevant role in the discovery of accurate biomarkers for transplant rejection diagnostics. Studies have reported consistent evidence of differential expression associated with transplant rejection, although issues such as experimental heterogeneity hinder a more systematic characterization of observed molecular changes. Special attention has been giving to large-scale mRNA expression profiling in rejection, whereas there is still room for improvements in the characterization of miRnome in this condition.

It reveals that the current SC research endeavours are predominantly oriented towards the macro-industry level, the environmental dimension and the internal stakeholders. Additionally, more emphasis has been provided on the final project deliverable compared to the project processes. Overall, this study makes three specific contributions: i) the current thrust areas of SC research in India have been identified while pointing out the imbalance in this academic pursuit; ii) a deductive content analysis framework has been developed that provides a generic template for conducting similar SLRs in the context of other countries; and iii) multiple research gaps have been identified and suggestions to design future studies are proposed based on extant SC literature, especially from similar developing economies. Therefore, despite its Indian focus, this review allows implications for other developing economies set for a similar socio-economic transition and growth in construction output. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Construction industry; Deductive content analysis; Developing countries; India; Sustainable construction; Triple Bottom Line","Climate change; Construction industry; Developing countries; Economics; Construction outputs; Construction projects; Content analysis; Developing economies; India; Sustainable construction; Systematic literature review (SLR); Triple Bottom Line; Sustainable development","Goel, A.; School of Construction Management, National Institute of Construction Management and ResearchIndia; email: agoel@nicmar.ac.in",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

In total, 96 cloud computing studies from 2009 to June 2018 that used SEM obtained from four databases are selected, and relevant data are extracted to answer the research questions. Findings: A trend of increasing SEM usage over years in cloud studies is observed, where technology adoption studies are found to be more common than the use studies. Articles appear under four main domains, namely, business, personal use, education and health care. Technology acceptance model (TAM) is found to be the most commonly used theory. Adoption, intention to use and actual usage are the most common selections for dependent variables in SEM models, whereas security and privacy concerns, costs, ease of use, risks and usefulness are the most common selections for causal factors. Originality/value: Previous cloud computing SLR studies did not focus on statistical analysis method used in primary studies. This review will display the current state of SEM studies in cloud domain for all future academics and practical professionals. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cloud computing; Continuous technology usage; Structural equation modeling; Systematic literature review; Technology adoption","Cloud computing; Design/methodology/approach; Statistical analysis methods; Structural equation modeling; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technology acceptance model; Technology adoption; Technology usages; Computation theory","Pişirir, E.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Hacettepe UniversityTurkey; email: erhanpisirir@hacettepe.edu.tr",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0368492X,,,,"English","Kybernetes",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069044666

The aim of this paper is to first confirm that cryptolaundering systems can indeed be defined as complex socio-technical systems and second to present the findings from a systematic review of the literature to determine the extent to which previous research has adopted a systems thinking perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The study involved a SLR of studies published in the peer-reviewed literature between 2009 and 2018. Rasmussen’s risk management framework (Rasmussen, 1997) was used to evaluate the extent to which a systems thinking perspective had been adopted. Findings: The cryptolaundering process is considered to be a complex socio-technical system. The review demonstrates that no previous studies have defined cryptolaundering as a complex socio-technical system or used systems thinking framework approach to evaluate how criminals, regulatory bodies or law enforcement entities understand processes and assess risk within cryptolaundering systems. It is argued that using such an approach to the cryptolaundering process would likely improve assessing criminal risk analyses of cryptolaundering and assist law enforcement and regulatory bodies with understanding risk management during the laundering of cryptocurrencies. Originality/value: Future assessments of cryptolaundering using socio-technical system analytical processes may afford law enforcement and regulatory bodies the opportunity to improve intervention techniques and identify gaps in regulations and enforcement. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cryptocurrency; Money laundering; Socio-technical systems",,"Desmond, D.B.; Centre for Human Factors and Sociotechnical Systems, University of the Sunshine Coast, Sunshine CoastAustralia; email: dennis.desmond@research.usc.edu.au",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13685201,,,,"English","J.

However, another problem with e-learning, which is lack of student motivation, still remains. Some researchers must apply gamification in e-learning with the aim of giving participation and increasing student motivation. Characteristics of different users, the same learning content, and static gamification elements do not increase the expected motivation. To overcome this problem, gamification must be adapted to the characteristics of the learners. This study uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to analyze research components, methods, and framework used in adaptive gamification. The first step is to determine the research question (RQ) and then to search on several kinds of literature published in popular journal databases, namely IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus, Springerlink and ACM from 2011 - 2019. As a result of a review of 25 selected articles, there are four components of adaptive gamification, namely, player/learner profiles, learning style, behavior, and skill/knowledge. Meanwhile, there are eleven types of methods used in adaptive gamification. The most popular method is scoring and Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM). Generally, the proposed framework consists of three elements namely adaptive gamification engine, adaptive component, and gamification display. © 2019 IEEE.","adaptive; e-learning; gamification; SLR; systematic literature review","E-learning; Motivation; Adaptive components; Learning contents; Learning Style; Learning technology; Research questions; Student motivation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Gamification",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21556830,9781728124186,,,"English","Proceeding Int.

The method used a systematic literature review (SLR) about automatic text summarization. The results obtained are that research on automatic text summarization is still relevant to date. The extractive approach is still in demand in the past three years because the extractive is easier than abstractive and the opportunity to combine methods is still open, for example using a neuro computing approach, namely the emergence of a new DQN method (Deep Q-Network) which shows comparable results and even better. The text summarization research trend has also undergone a slight change in the past three years where new things have emerged that are trends that are leading to optimization, how to optimize text summarization performance in order to get high accuracy. © 2019 IEEE","Automatic text summarization; Dataset; Method; SLR; Trend research","Automatic machines; Automatic text summarization; Dataset; Extractive approach; Information contents; Method; Systematic literature review (SLR); Text summarization; Text processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728116556,,,"English","Int.

Firstly, a review of literature that discusses the problems and challenges was undertaken. Methods and theories adopted were reviewed to identify the existing approach and perspective on resulting factors that influenced EA adoption. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in the review process, 16 articles were selected. A total of 19 challenges and problems were identified such as EA misconceptions, overlapping organizational rules, unclear leadership as well as lack of business and IT alignment. A sum of 15 factors from multidimensional contexts that influenced the EA adoption in the organization were also discussed, such as top management support, governance, communication as well as EA knowledge and skill. This SLR also reflected that there were relatively little empirical studies conducted on EA adoption studies. The existing studies tend to apply single and multiple theories from the organization and management domains in one study. By understanding such issues and challenges, risks can be reduced and avoided when introducing EA to organizations, and subsequently ease the deployment process. Thus, this article may shed light on understanding the organizational-related factors and the underlying relationships of EA adoption. As a result, an effective adoption of EA can be facilitated in the organizations.

The communication is realized through the On-Board Unit (OBU) equipped in vehicles. The concern of VANET is to provide a safe journey to the passengers. Although its significant high mobility of vehicles may cause a loss in connection or security attacks. Objective: The aim behind systematic literature review (SLR) is to identify the diverse type of security attacks in VANET and their respective solutions to handle those attack. This study mainly focuses on VANET centric security attacks and categorizes them along with the solutions to handle these attacks. Method: By using kitchenham guideline for systematic review and PRISMA flow for study selection to ensure coverage of all relevant studies we initially came up with 403 articles. Among these studies, 84 studies were qualified to be relevant according to 4 defined research questions. After identification and categorization of VANET centric attacks, proposed solutions a mapping between attacks and solution is provided. Results: Result of this systematic literature review suggest that identifies Access Management is a major concern in VANET with 44% of selected studies followed by Privacy 28% and Sybil attack 5%. Similarly, numerous security concerns such as Message Authentication 3%, Trust Management 4% and Black Hole attack 3% receives considerably lesser attention by the research community. Conclusions: In the context of security-related solutions which technique found to be most widely used to resolve the problem. The contribution of this study is considered important because there is no such study that has provided such an extensive overview of VANET security attacks and their perspective solutions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Authentication; Privacy; Security; Security attacks; Systematic Literature Review (SLR); Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET)","Authentication; Data privacy; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Access management; Message authentication; Research communities; Research questions; Security; Security attacks; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Network security",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450371636,,,"English","ACM Int.

Runtime adaptation plays a significant role in supporting the optimization of data processing tasks. In recent years runtime adaptation has received significant interest in scientific literature. However, so far no categorization of the enactment approaches for runtime adaptation in stream processing has been established. Objective: This paper identifies and characterizes different approaches towards the enactment of runtime adaptation in stream processing with a main focus on latency as quality dimension. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) targeting five main research questions. An automated search, resulting in 244 papers, was conducted. 75 papers published between 2006 and 2018 were finally included. From the selected papers, we extracted data like processing problems, adaptation goals, enactment approaches of adaptation, enactment techniques, evaluation metrics as well as evaluation parameters used to trigger the enactment of adaptation in their evaluation. Results: We identified 17 different enactment approaches and categorized them into a taxonomy. For each, we extracted the underlying technique used to implement this enactment approach. Further, we identified 9 categories of processing problems, 6 adaptation goals, 9 evaluation metrics and 12 evaluation parameters according to the extracted data properties. Conclusion: We observed that the research interest on enactment approaches to the adaptation of stream processing has significantly increased in recent years. The most commonly applied enactment approaches are parameter adaptation to tune parameters or settings of the processing, load balancing used to re-distribute workloads, and processing scaling to dynamically scale up and down the processing. In addition to latency, most adaptations also address resource fluctuation / bottleneck problems. For presenting a dynamic environment to evaluate enactment approaches, researchers often change input rates or processing workloads. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Enactment; Latency; Runtime adaptation; Stream processing; Systematic literature review","Big data; Data mining; Parameter estimation; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Enactment; Latency; Runtime adaptation; Stream processing; Systematic literature review; Data handling","Qin, C.; University of Hildesheim, Institute of Computer Science, Software Systems Engineering, Universitätsplatz 1, Germany; email: qin@sse.uni-hildesheim.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062965713

Using extant literature, we made an attempt to understand the relationship among variables, which was missing in extant literature and proposed a conceptual framework using ISM (interpretive structural modelling). Further, the variables were also categorized using MICMAC analysis. Design: The research procedure was methodically framed. It comprised of primary as well as secondary data & information. We used interpretative structural modelling (ISM) as a tool to understand the linkages and relation among the variables. We used systematic literature review (SLR) method to find the variables from the present literature and further used fuzzy MICMAC analysis to understand the composite balance amid the variables. Findings: The findings using ISM modeling indicated three levels. The output suggested that Fee Appropriateness and Infrastructure were the most significant factors, the second level of the model is Skills Acquired and Career Aspiration, and the third level is Academic Excellence and Institutional Factors. In order to ensure the attainment of high level of management education, the educational institutions may focus their attention on academic excellence, good infrastructure, positively focusing on enhancing institutional features, and skill development of students to fulfill their career aspirations. The fuzzy MICMAC output suggests Fee Appropriateness and Career Aspiration were the dependence variables. Academic Excellence and Institutional Features were the linkage variables and Skills Acquired and Infrastructure were the driving variables. Research Limitations: The study was based on expert opinion; hence, the potential to capture unique insights was limited. Limited variables were also considered for the ISM model. The application in a real situation would need some changes. Originality/Value: It is the first study to propose a conceptual model on Fee Appropriateness for management education using ISM.

It means that searching “value co-creation” AND “P.A.” appeared contributions of “value co-production” and “crisis communication” and vice-versa. The second reached result was to inscribe the theoretical approach of value co-creation into the interaction between citizens and public administration. Research limitations/implications: Firstly, concentrating the research only on most recent articles from peer reviewed journals tends to exclude conference paper and other eventual contributions. Secondly, because the SLR has been conducted by searching with the keywords, only articles, which appeared in relation to the keywords connection in those databases, have been selected, excluding those papers closed to the themes, but classified under other terms. Originality/value: This work value consists of trying to contextualize crisis communication during natural disasters in a theoretical context different from that which literature usually considers, i.e. value co-creation between public administration and citizens. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Active citizenship; Crisis communication; Public administration; Public management; Value co-creation; Value co-production","Disasters; Active citizenship; Co-production; Crisis communications; Public management; Value co creations; Public administration","Capolupo, N.; Department of Business Studies and Research, University of SalernoItaly; email: nicola.capolupo@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0368492X,,,,"English","Kybernetes",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078193222

Mounting ecological and societal concerns are driving construction to ‘go green’. Green supply chain management offers the potential of a systemic approach to facilitate transformation of the sector. Research on green supply chain management in construction has been growing in recent times but to date has not been systematically brought together. A systematic literature review (SLR) is presented, applying the high standards of rigour and transparency required by the methodology. From an initial search result of 207 papers, 44 were included in the detailed analysis. The papers are described in terms of publication outlet, date of publication, geographic setting, methods used, tools and techniques, conceptual definition, the role of stakeholders and practical implications. The findings are synthesized to propose a categorization of approach and a comprehensive definition of green supply chain management in construction. An agenda for future research is outlined which emphasizes the need for an end-to-end perspective, engagement with the unique characteristics of the industry, a focus on the ultimate goals of environmental sustainability, and on gaps in practical guidance, use of insights from relevant theoretical perspectives, and expansion to include critical stances. © 2019","Construction industry; Green supply chain management; Sustainable supply chain management; Systematic literature review","Construction industry; Environmental impact; Sustainable development; Environmental sustainability; Geographic setting; Green supply chain management; Practical guidance; Sustainable supply chains; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Tools and techniques; Supply chain management","Badi, S.; Faculty of Business & Law, The British University in Dubai (BUiD)United Arab Emirates; email: Sulafa.badi@buid.ac.ae",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The purpose of this study was to develop a contextualised intervention for promoting PA among women living with HIV and AIDS (WLWHA) of low socioeconomic status (SES). A secondary aim of the study was to optimise the PA intervention using behavioural theory/ frameworks derived from preliminary studies and the literature. Methods: The Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) for designing behaviour change interventions was used. This method was further supplemented by evidence from the literature, systematic literature review (SLR), a concurrent mixed methods study and two cross-sectional studies. The SLR aided in determining the theoretical frameworks to inform the intervention, the specific PA behaviours to be targeted by the intervention, the intervention functions, the intervention policy category and the mode of delivery of the intervention. The concurrent mixed methods study was used to identify key factors that needed to change in order for participants to engage in regular PA. The first cross-sectional study was used to determine the gender to be targeted by the study. The second cross-sectional study was used to determine the domain and intensity of PA to target in the intervention. Results: A face-to-face context-sensitive PA intervention employing 14 behavioural change techniques was designed. The PA intervention (a) utilised the Transtheoretical model of behaviour change and the Social Cognitive theory as the underpinning theoretical frameworks (b) included convenient PAs, such as walking, doing simple home-based exercises, engaging in activities of daily living or doing simple exercises at the community centre (c) used education, reward, training in PA, modelling exercise activities and enablement to increase the opportunity to engage in PA as intervention functions (d) used service provision as policy priorities, and (e) used a direct face-to-face mode of delivery. Conclusions: The PA intervention emphasises behavioural techniques for increasing PA participation, such as goal-setting, self-monitoring, strategies for overcoming PA barriers, social support and rewards. The intervention employs strategies that highlight low-cost local PA resources and opportunities to help HIV infected women of low SES to participate in PA. The BCW provides a useful and comprehensive framework for the development of evidence and theory-based PA interventions for PLWHA of low SES. The BCW can thus be used in the development of interventions that 'talk' to policy by bridging the health inequality gap. © 2019 The Author(s).","AIDS; Behaviour change wheel; HIV; Physical activity; Socioeconomic status","adult; article; behavior change; conceptual framework; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; education; exercise; female; gender; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; male; nonhuman; reward; self monitoring; Social Cognitive Theory; social status; social support; systematic review; theoretical study; walking; acquired immune deficiency syndrome; evidence based practice; health promotion; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; organization and management; poverty; procedures; psychology; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Cross-Sectional Studies; Evidence-Based Practice; Exercise; Female; Health Promotion; HIV Infections; Humans; Poverty; Systematic Reviews as Topic","Ley, C.; Institute of Sport Science, University of Vienna, Auf der Schmelz 6, Austria; email: clemensley@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712458,,,"31208375","English","BMC Public Health",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067513179

It is important for librarians to know which methods of teaching engineering information literacy (EIL) are most effective for student learning, in order to make efficient and effective use of student and librarian time. Purpose/Hypothesis - The authors reviewed the existing literature to find indications of the most effective methods for teaching and/or integrating EIL, both in face-to-face and online instruction. Design/Method - The authors have completed the first stages of a systematic literature review (SLR), through the creation of the final dataset. The initial searches generated a set of 1224 papers prior to duplicate removal. Duplicate removal and multiple rounds of review, using authors-created inclusion and exclusion criteria, narrowed the final dataset to 13 papers. Scope/Method - The lessons learned in the process around searching, tools for data evaluation, and articulation of criteria are presented. As a result of this portion of the SLR process, the authors identified characteristics of the undergraduate-focused EIL literature that are shared. Results/Discussion - A brief summary of the process to arrive at a final dataset of 13 papers, the challenges in the process, and the refinements made at each step are outlined. Conclusion - There are several preliminary conclusions to be drawn, many of which will not be surprising to the engineering librarian community. The dataset came down to just 13 items because much of the EIL literature is based on student self-report data on how the class went, or was it enjoyable, rather than on actual student learning gains. As such, these papers did not meet the criteria for demonstrated learning gains as a measure of effectiveness. In addition, some papers were excluded for lack of clarity about methods. In these studies it is not evident how either the intervention and/or the assessment was conducted, with regard to timing, instrument used, etc. Some additional papers were excluded because a control or comparison group was not included to establish “effectiveness” of the intervention. Overall, the authors note the EIL literature frequently reports descriptive statistics, showing that data has been gathered, but sometimes falls short of a full analysis that allows the researchers to draw meaningful/well-grounded conclusions from the data. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019",,,,,"American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,,"English","ASEE Annu.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken across 96 journals ranked by the Association of Business Schools. The initial search yielded 86 papers. Further scrutiny of these studies led to the development of exclusion criteria, resulting in a refined list of 32 articles which advance understanding of artisan entrepreneurship. Using an open coding approach, this SLR then identified seven core themes and 16 sub-themes which the extant literature examines. Findings: This SLR finds that artisan entrepreneurship research contributes to understanding of entrepreneurial behaviour, context, motivation, development, resources, diversity and classification. It provides timely insights into coopetition practices, the reciprocal relationship between place and entrepreneurship and the coexistence of social and economic goals. It also reveals characteristics which facilitate venture development, discovers the mutability of various forms of capital, highlights the necessity of studying diverse experiences and identifies benefits and limits of typologies. Main elements of the resulting research agenda include calls for more quantitative research, further attention to context and more holistic treatment of a wider variety of stories. Originality/value: This paper presents the first SLR of craft and artisan entrepreneurship research. It not only identifies, analyses and critiques the main streams in the literature, therefore providing an overview of the state of the field, but also highlights areas where this scholarship contributes to understanding of entrepreneurship and upon which future research can build. Artisan entrepreneurship is thus established as worthy of investigation in its own right and as an appropriate context in which to explore entrepreneurial processes. Furthermore, this SLR presents an agenda for future research to advance understanding of artisan entrepreneurship. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artisan; Craft; Cultural and Creative Industries; Entrepreneurs; Entrepreneurship; Small firms",,"Pret, T.; Lubin School of Business, Pace UniversityUnited States; email: tpret@pace.edu",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13552554,,,,"English","Int.

A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted on the costs and HRQoL associated with current treatments for CKD-related anemia among dialysis-dependent (DD) patients. Materials and methods: The authors searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS EED, and NHS HTA for English-language publications. Original studies published between January 1, 2000 and March 17, 2017 meeting the following criteria were included: adult population; study focus was CKD-related anemia; included results on patients receiving iron supplementation, red blood cell transfusion, or erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs); reported results on HRQoL and/or costs. Studies which included patients with DD-CKD, did not directly compare different treatments, and had designs relevant to the objective were retained. HRQoL and cost outcomes, including healthcare resource utilization (HRU), were extracted and summarized in a narrative synthesis. Results: A total of 1,625 publications were retrieved, 15 of which met all inclusion criteria. All identified studies included ESAs as a treatment of interest. Two randomized controlled trials reported that ESA treatment improves HRQoL relative to placebo. Across eight studies comparing HRQoL of patients achieving high vs low hemoglobin (Hb) targets, aiming for higher Hb targets with ESAs generally led to modest HRQoL improvements. Two studies reported that ESA-treated patients had lower costs and HRU compared to untreated patients. One study found that aiming for higher vs lower Hb targets led to reduced HRU, while two other reported that this led to a reduction in cost-effectiveness. Limitations: Heterogeneity of study designs and outcomes; a meta-analysis could not be performed. Conclusions: ESA-treated patients undergoing dialysis incurred lower costs, lower HRU, and had better HRQoL relative to ESA-untreated patients. However, treatment to higher Hb targets led to modest HRQoL improvements compared to lower Hb targets. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The process of developing the mobile software/application proceeds amidst testing phase to verify the correctness of the mobile app. The estimation of testing plays a vital role in the effective completion of testing. Objective: To identify how estimation of test effort for mobile applications is distinct from other software via published literature and from mobile software organizations. Second is to recognize different issues in adapting traditional test estimation methods to the mobile domain and if suggestions from survey results could be helpful in providing an improved test estimation model for mobile applications. Method: A systematic literature review is conducted followed by a survey through an online questionnaire filled from experienced mobile application developers and testers. Results: The results from SLR cover identification of mobile app specific characteristics and reports test effort estimation techniques in the mobile domain. Findings from survey corroborate that a) Function Point/Test Point Analysis is highly adapted traditional test estimation technique to mobile domain; b) Challenges like uncertain requirements, no tool support for test estimation, complexity in testing, client miscommunication etc. are reported; c)Suggestions to improve test estimation process include proper test planning, adoption of agile methodology, healthier communication among client, developer, and tester etc.; d) On the basis of responses, Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) identifies “Diverse Devices and OS” along with “Type of App” as highly influential mobile app characteristic on the test estimation process. Conclusion: Results conclude that the importance of identified mobile app characteristics from SLR cannot be ignored in the estimation process of mobile software testing. There might be a possibility to improve existing test estimation techniques for mobile apps by giving weight to mobile app specific characteristics and by considering suggestions from experienced developers and testers. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Mobile applications; Software engineering; Survey; Systematic literature review (SLR); Test effort estimation","Application programs; Mobile computing; Software engineering; Surveying; Surveys; Testing; Agile Methodologies; Analytical hierarchical process; Estimation techniques; Mobile applications; Online questionnaire; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Test efforts; Software testing","Kaur, A.60, Kabir Park, opp. Guru Nanak Dev University, India; email: anumahal@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062221200

Most smartphone app developers follow the same design principles in designing mobile app's user interface. But in the case of designing for users with visually impaired, the user interface design is not always easy. Gesture engineering is required to improve the existing gestures in order to allow visually impaired people to utilize their smartphones better and easier. The amount of existing gestures design studies for visually impaired people is few and need to be further increased in order to ease visually impaired people to use smartphones. More solutions such as new gestures or forms of input modalities for smartphone applications needed to be provided to enhance the use of smartphone by visually impaired people. The objective of this paper is to comprehend better and closely review the current state of analysis concerning gesture design for visually impaired people on mobile platforms. A systematic literature review has been conducted as an approach to gather, examine and analyze knowledge from previous articles targeted on this analysis field which addresses a range of topics published online between 2010 and 2018. We used a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to collect and review studies by following a predefined review procedure that imposes a set of research questions used to generate keywords to be searched on digital databases. The resulting articles are filtered and chosen based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria of study. 22 studies had been identified presenting analysis concerning gesture design for visually impaired people reviewed through systematic review process that draw knowledge to answer an outlined set of research queries. Topics such as gesture design for visually impaired people, problems faced by them while using smartphone and eyes-free design solutions had been analyzed. From the analysis, the studies targeted on gesture design for visually impaired people are mostly highlighted and this successively caved a path for more analysis and future research. The review process concluded that despite of having numerous studies that provide solutions for gesture design for visually impaired people, it is still insufficient to solve the gesture design problems faced by them. This study shows the research gap that includes existing issues in current gesture design which promises a new area of research that can provide better solutions to provide a favorable experience of visually impaired people while using smartphones. © BEIESP.","Mobile Interactions; Systematic Literature Review; Universal Design; User Gestures; Visually Impaired People",,,,"Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication",22783075,,,,"English","Int.

A main reason is the decreasing lack of predictability of markets, technologies, and customer behaviors. New approaches for product roadmapping seem to be necessary in order to cope with today's highly dynamic conditions. Little research is available with respect to such new approaches. Objective: In order to better understand the state of the art and to identify research gaps, this article presents a review of the scientific literature with respect to product roadmapping. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) with respect to identify papers in the field of computer science. Results: After filtering, the search resulted in a set of 23 relevant papers. The identified papers focus on different aspects such as roadmap types, processes for creating and updating roadmaps, problems and challenges with roadmapping, approaches to visualize roadmaps, generic frameworks and specific aspects such as the combination of roadmaps with business modeling. Overall, the scientific literature covers many important aspects of roadmapping but does provide only little knowledge on how to create product roadmaps under highly dynamic conditions. Research gaps address, for instance, the inclusion of goals or outcomes into product roadmaps, the alignment of a roadmap with a product vision, and the inclusion of product discovery activities in product roadmaps. In addition, the transformation from traditional roadmapping processes to new ways of roadmapping is not sufficiently addressed in the scientific literature. © 2019 IEEE.","agile development; product discovery; product management; product roadmap; product strategy; product vision; roadmapping","Commerce; Systems engineering; Agile development; product discovery; Product management; Product strategy; Product vision; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Engineering research",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728134017,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using 65 articles published between 2006 and 2017, and it has been subjected to descriptive and thematic analysis. Findings: The descriptive analysis revealed that the majority of the articles were about (60 per cent) PEoLB operations, followed by (23 per cent) PEoLB concepts. Only 17 per cent of the articles have dealt with PEoLB-related strategic approaches. The thematic analysis elaborated on the literature development; interrelationships between PEoLB concepts and operations; impediments of introducing sustainability on these operations, remedial measures and information-based strategic approaches to achieve sustainability. Based on the findings, a conceptual framework for sustainable PEoLB operations is proposed. Furthermore, four areas of potential future research are discussed. Research limitations/implications: This study presents a future research agenda including best practices to plan PEoLB operations and the development of optimisation models, risk management and information-based strategic approaches. Practical implications: The proposed conceptual research framework triggers and nurtures potential pathways to introduce sustainable PEoLB operations under sound information flow. This could create a basis for future empirical studies in filling the identified gaps in literature. The framework could also assist practitioners in mitigating risks associated with transportation, storing and contamination of salvaged materials through enhanced information flow. In addition, the framework provides some managerial guidance to organisations seeking ways of establishing sustainability during reverse logistics (RL) operations. Originality/value: This paper presents an SLR of an emerging area of research that encapsulates closed-loop supply chain through sustainable RL operations. The study highlights the interrelationships between PEoLB concepts and operations. It develops a robust approach to effectively manage the PEoLB operations underpinned by a sound information flow to facilitate sustainability. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Construction; Methodology; Supply chain management","Construction; Materials handling; Risk management; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; Closed-loop supply chain; Conceptual frameworks; Descriptive analysis; Design/methodology/approach; Methodology; Strategic approaches; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Research and development management","Chileshe, N.; School of Natural and Built Environments, Natural and Built Environments Research Centre (NBERC), University of South AustraliaAustralia; email: nicholas.chileshe@unisa.edu.au",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09699988,,,,"English","Eng.

The purpose of this paper is to identify the existing research gaps in LM as well as to group them into respective themes. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) of peer reviewed journal articles in LM was carried out by the authors, based on four major publishers, namely, Emerald Online, Science Direct, Springer Link and Taylor & Francis. In total, 120 articles published in 30 journals during 2005–2016 were collected which revealed LM research gaps. A simple affinity diagram was applied in order to group the research gaps into logical themes. Findings: A large number of research gaps are identified in the LM literature and meaningful themes of these gaps are also revealed. Research limitations/implications: The SLR carried out by the authors is based on only four academic journal publishers and some of other publishers might have been missed out in this search. Excluding articles focusing on an individual Lean principle or tool/technique is also a limitation of the present SLR. Practical implications: Researchers and practitioners can use the LM research gaps presented in this study for further development of LM methodology. Originality/value: Presenting LM research gaps analytically and grouping them into meaningful themes, significantly differentiates the present SLR study from those published so far. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Lean manufacturing; Research gap; Systematic literature review",,"Psomas, E.; Department of Business Administration of Food and Agricultural Enterprises, University of PatrasGreece; email: epsomas@upatras.gr",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0265671X,,,,"English","Int.

The objective of this study was to conduct a SLR of published data on the relationship between outcomes and QoL or HCRU. Materials and methods: Electronic searches were conducted in Embase and Medline, for articles which reported on the association between outcomes and QoL or HCRU. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to identify the most relevant articles and studies and extract their data. A summary table was developed to illustrate the strength of associations, based on p-values and correlations. Results: One thousand and two abstracts were retrieved; five duplicates were excluded; 997 abstracts were screened and 95 references were retained for full-text screening. Thrirty-one references were included in the review. The most commonly used questionnaire, which also demonstrated the strongest associations (defined as a p < 0.0001 and/or correlation ±0.70), was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) associated with HCRU and QoL (the SF-36, the Schizophrenia Quality-of-Life questionnaire [S-QOL-18], the Quality-of-Life Scale [QLS]). Other robust correlations included the Clinical Global Impression–Severity (CGI-S) with QoL (EQ5D), relapse with HCRU, and remission with QoL (EQ5D). Lastly, functioning (Work Rehabilitation Questionnaire [WORQ] and Personal and Social Performance Scale [PSP]) was found to be associated to QoL (QLS and Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptics Questionnaire [SWN]). Limitations: This study included data from an 11-year period, and other instruments less frequently used may be further investigated. Conclusions: The evidence suggests that the PANSS is the clinical outcome that currently provides the most frequent and systematic associations with HCRU and QoL endpoints in schizophrenia. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","associations; functioning; healthcare resource utilization; outcomes; quality-of-life; relapse; remission; Schizophrenia; systematic literature review","Clinical Global Impression scale; health care utilization; human; outcome assessment; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; quality of life; quality of life scale; questionnaire; rating scale; Review; schizophrenia; schizophrenia quality of life questionnaire; Short Form 36; subjective well being under neuroleptics questionnaire; systematic review; work rehabilitation questionnaire; chronic disease; economics; health care planning; pathophysiology; patient attitude; recurrent disease; schizophrenia; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; neuroleptic agent; Antipsychotic Agents; Chronic Disease; Health Resources; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Quality of Life; Recurrence; Schizophrenia; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome","Germain, N.; Creativ-Ceutical, 215 rue du Faubourg Saint Honoré, France; email: nge@creativ-ceutical.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",13696998,,JMECF,"30696307","English","J.

Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has greatly improved the performance of models. However, the results are still not sufficiently satisfying. Machines cannot imitate human brains and the way they communicate, so it remains an ongoing task.

In this study a comprehensive Systematic Literature Review (SLR) provides a brief overview of improvements in image captioning over the last four years. The main focus of the paper is to explain the most common techniques and the biggest challenges in image captioning and to summarize the results from the newest papers. Inconsistent comparison of results achieved in image captioning was noticed during this study and hence the awareness of incomplete data collection is raised in this paper. Therefore, it is very important to compare results of a newly created model produced with the newest information and not only with the state of the art methods.

A systematic literature search (in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through September 2017) was conducted to identify NMAs that compared the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of VTE in the acute and extended treatment settings. The NMAs included randomized controlled trials comparing multiple DOACs, low-molecular weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). The quality of the NMA results were evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment. The SLR identified 294 records and nine NMAs (68 trials). Among the NMAs, three evaluated the acute treatment setting, five the extended, and one in both treatment settings. The NMAs showed a significant reduction in major bleeding and clinically relevant bleeding (CRB) with apixaban compared to other DOACs. Major bleeding with apixaban was reduced compared to dabigatran, edoxaban, and fondaparinux-VKA combination in all comparisons in the acute setting (range of effect estimates: 0.30–0.43). CRB was reduced with apixaban compared to dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban in the acute and extended settings (range of effect estimates: 0.23–0.72). No significant differences were seen in efficacy outcomes between the DOACs. This SLR of NMAs systematically collected all indirect evidence of the impact of apixaban compared to other anticoagulants in patients with VTE. In the absence of head-to-head trials, well-conducted NMAs provide the best evidence. © 2019 The Authors","Deep vein thrombosis; Direct oral anticoagulants; Network meta-analysis; Pulmonary embolism; Systematic literature review; Venous thromboembolism","antivitamin K; apixaban; dabigatran; edoxaban; fondaparinux; heparin; low molecular weight heparin; rivaroxaban; anticoagulant agent; heparin; vitamin K group; anticoagulant therapy; Bayes theorem; bleeding; deep vein thrombosis; drug efficacy; drug safety; human; lung embolism; mortality; patient selection; population research; priority journal; recurrent disease; Review; risk factor; statistical model; treatment outcome; bleeding; meta analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); venous thromboembolism; Anticoagulants; Hemorrhage; Heparin; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thromboembolism; Vitamin K","Lister, S.; Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Uxbridge Business Park, Sanderson Road, Uxbridge, Middlesex, United Kingdom; email: steven.lister@bms.com",,"Academic Press",10436618,,PHMRE,"30905806","English","Pharmacol.

Using the SLR method, a total 15 challenging factors were identified from the 26 selected primary articles. The investigated challenging factors were further categorized based on firms' types (client-vendor) and time periods (2001-2009 and 2010-2017). The purpose of this categorization is to assess the significance level of each investigated challenging factor with respect to firms' types and time periods. The paper also highlighted the critical challenging factors of RCM process by following the criteria of a factor having frequency ≥ 50% as critical. The outcomes revealed that five out of fifteen challenging factors are critical for the executing the RCM activities in GSD. We are confident that the results of this study will be useful in tackling the challenges related to RCM process in GSD that is significant for developing the quality projects. © 2019 University of Bahrain.

This organelle has its own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and genetic variants in this molecule can alter the normal energy metabolism in the brain, contributing to the development of a wide assortment of Neurological Disorders (ND), including neurodevelopmental syndromes, neurodegenerative diseases and neuropsychiatric disorders. These ND are comprised by a heterogeneous group of syndromes and diseases that encompass different cognitive phenotypes and behavioral disorders, such as autism, Asperger's syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Huntington disease, Leigh Syndrome and bipolar disorder. In this work we carried out a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify and describe the mitochondrial genetic variants associated with the occurrence of ND. Most of genetic variants found in mtDNA were associated with Single Nucleotide Polimorphisms (SNPs), ~79%, with ~15% corresponding to deletions, ~3% to Copy Number Variations (CNVs), ~2% to insertions and another 1% included mtDNA replication problems and genetic rearrangements. We also found that most of the variants were associated with coding regions of mitochondrial proteins but were also found in regulatory transcripts (tRNA and rRNA) and in the D-Loop replication region of the mtDNA. After analysis of mtDNA deletions and CNV, none of them occur in the D-Loop region. This SLR shows that all transcribed mtDNA molecules have mutations correlated with ND. Finally, we describe that all mtDNA variants found were associated with deterioration of cognitive (dementia) and intellectual functions, learning disabilities, developmental delays, and personality and behavior problems. © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Mitochondria Research Society","Genetic variants; Mitochondrial DNA; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurodevelopmental syndromes; Neurological disorders; Neuropsychiatric disorders; Systematic literature review","mitochondrial DNA; mitochondrial protein; ribosome RNA; transfer RNA; mitochondrial DNA; behavior disorder; copy number variation; dementia; developmental delay; disease association; gene deletion; gene insertion; gene rearrangement; genetic association; genetic correlation; genetic variability; human; intellectual impairment; learning disorder; mitochondrial DNA replication; mitochondrial genetics; neurologic disease; personality disorder; priority journal; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism; systematic review; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; neurologic disease; pathology; DNA, Mitochondrial; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Humans; Nervous System Diseases","Herai, R.H.; Graduate Program in Health Sciences (PPGCS), School of Medicine, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Paraná (PUCPR), Rua Imaculada Conceição, 1155 - Prado Velho, Brazil; email: roberto.herai@pucpr.br",,"Elsevier B.V.",15677249,,MITOC,"30218715","English","Mitochondrion",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054819882

However, currently, there is lack of studies to understand the role of digital technology and entrepreneur orientation on influencing the performance of SME’s in Indonesia. This study aims to develop a conceptual model linking entrepreneurial orientation, digital technology capability and SME performance. This study is using Systematic literature review (SLR) method. The result of SLR was used as the based for the concept development. More than 1100 publication published from 2010 to 2019 were screened with entrepreneurial orientation, digital technology and SMEs’ performance as keywords. Finally, 34 journals were included for this review. Based on the review there were three possible relationships in the conceptual model which are (1) there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance; (2) there is a positive relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and digital technology capability and (3) there is a positive relationship between digital technology capability and firm performance. It concludes with the need for further study to find empirical validation of the three relationships.

However, different agencies use different processes and methodologies, resulting in variation in recommendations. Objectives: The objectives were to review full HTAs for a new technology for diabetes management, flash glucose monitoring (FGM), with the aim of summarizing similarities/differences in processes, methodologies, and recommendations from the perspective of everyday clinical practice. Methods: A literature review was conducted using online HTA resources. Results: Four full HTAs were identified (Canary Islands, France, Catalunya, and Norway); one issued a conditional recommendation for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) with controlled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (Spain; Canary Islands), one issued a broader recommendation for patients with T1DM and T2DM (France), and two reported that there was insufficient evidence to support a recommendation (Spain [Catalunya] and Norway). The most comprehensive and stringent of the available HTAs were those in the Canary Islands and Norway, which included systematic literature reviews (SLRs), consultation with patient groups and clinicians, GRADE evidence quality assessments, and full economic models. Comprehensive HTAs either did not recommend FGM (Norway) or restricted the recommendation to a small subpopulation of the overall diabetes population (Canary Islands). Conclusion: HTAs represent a valuable additional resource for clinicians to consider alongside clinical evidence, guidelines, and consensus papers; however, interpreting recommendations requires an understanding of the processes behind these recommendations. In this review, comprehensive HTAs either recommended for a selected subpopulation based on RCT evidence or found insufficient evidence for a recommendation. © 2018 Diabetes Technology Society.","diabetes; flash glucose monitoring; health technology assessment","hemoglobin A1c; biomedical technology assessment; blood glucose monitoring; clinical assessment; clinical decision making; clinical practice; diabetes mellitus; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient satisfaction; practice guideline; quality of life; Review; blood; blood glucose monitoring; devices; diabetes mellitus; glucose blood level; invention; Blood Glucose; Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring; Diabetes Mellitus; Equipment and Supplies; Humans; Inventions; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Technology Assessment, Biomedical","Stueve, M.; Johnson & Johnson Medical GmbHGermany; email: mstueve@its.jnj.com",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",19322968,,,"30132687","English","J.

Software Engineering (SE) researchers have adopted a variety of methods of synthesizing data that originated in other disciplines. One of the qualitative data synthesis methods is meta-ethnography, which is being used in SE SLRs. Objective: We aim at studying the adoption of meta-ethnography in SE SLRs in order to understand how this method has been used in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study of the use of meta-ethnography by reviewing sixteen SLRs. We carried out an empirical inquiry by integrating SLR and confirmatory email survey. Results: There is a general lack of knowledge, or even awareness, of different aspects of meta-ethnography and/or how to apply it. Conclusion: There is a need of investment in gaining in-depth knowledge and skills of correctly applying meta-ethnography in order to increase the quality and reliability of the findings generated from SE SLRs. Our study reveals that meta-ethnography is a suitable method to SE research. We discuss challenges and propose recommendations of adopting meta-ethnography in SE.

This paper has performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the most significant/commonly studied challenges of requirement change management process and furthermore this process under GSD context. We identified ten challenges such as impact analysis, cost estimation, artifacts documents management, requirement traceability, requirements dependency, conflicts with existing requirements, time estimation, change prioritization, user involvement, and system destabilizing. Furthermore, three challenges such as communication and coordination, knowledge sharing, management, and Change Control Board (CCB) management are identified for globally distributed projects. We also mapped these identified challenges to Requirement Change Management Process (RCMP) outcomes proposed in our previous study. We believe that mapping between RCM challenges and RCMP outcomes will enhance the practical significance of this study results.

Nowadays, social media (SM) is becoming a valuable platform for facilitating knowledge sharing (KS) and communication, not only on a personal or individual level, but also for organizations. This trend has attracted significant attention from the professional and academic fields. However, despite the important and rapid growth of research in this area, few attempts have been made to systematically review and incorporate findings from previous surveys, and to assess the current state of research regarding social media's use in knowledge sharing. Objective: The main objective of this paper is to provide a better understanding, and a detailed review, of the current state of research regarding social media use for knowledge sharing. In this research, we conducted a systematic review approach to collect, analyze and synthesize data regarding the accuracy and value of previous articles focused on this research field, addressing a variety of topics, and published in digital databases between 2010 and 2016. Method: We used a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to collect and review studies by following a predefined review procedure, integrating both the automatic and manual search strategies, in order to cover all relevant research papers published in this period. Results: From the review study, we identified 103 selected primary studies presenting research about SM use for KS, reviewed through a systematic mapping approach that extracted relevant information to answer a defined set of research questions. We analyzed and categorized the published papers, covering numerous research topics including SM for KS user behavior, utility and benefits, social media platform and tools, and other topics that otherwise attract little attention. For this research, the majority of the studies reviewed focused on SM for KS user behaviors. This in turn highlighted a direction for further research. Conclusions: The systematic review indicated that, although SM is increasingly used for KS and giving a promising new area of research, a better understanding of the landscape and direction is not well reported.

These are time-consuming and complex tasks, so SRs are considered resource intensive, but published estimates of systematic-review resource requirements are largely anecdotal. We analyzed all Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE) SRs (n = 66) and maps (n = 20) published from 2012 to 2017 to estimate the average number of articles retained at each review stage. We also surveyed 33 experienced systematic reviewers to collate information on the rate at which those stages could be completed. In combination, these data showed that the average CEE SR takes an estimated 164 d (full-time equivalent) (SD 23), and the average CEE systematic map (SM) (excluding critical appraisal) takes 211 d (SD 53). While screening titles and abstracts is widely considered time-consuming, metadata extraction and critical appraisal took as long or longer to complete, especially for SMs. Given information about the planned methods and evidence base, we created a software tool that predicts time requirements of a SR or map with evidence-based defaults as a starting point. Our results shed light on the most time-consuming stages of the SR and mapping processes, will inform review planning, and can direct innovation to streamline processes. Future predictions of effort required to complete SRs and maps could be improved if authors provide more details on methods and results. © 2018 Society for Conservation Biology","carga laboral; compromiso de tiempo; cost; costo; efficiency; eficiencia; evidence synthesis; literature review; revisión de literatura; síntesis de evidencias; time commitment; workload","cost analysis; detection method; efficiency measurement; estimation method; literature review; map; metadata; planning method; prediction; software; environmental protection; methodology; questionnaire; Conservation of Natural Resources; Research Design; Surveys and Questionnaires","Haddaway, N.R.; Mistra EviEM, Stockholm Environment Institute, Linnégatan 87D, Sweden; email: neal_haddaway@hotmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",08888892,,CBIOE,"30285277","English","Conserv.

Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify studies that included original information on epidemiology, HRU and costs, and/or QoL associated with hypoglycemia in patients with DM in Spain, published in either Spanish or English, between January 2007 and April 2017. Results: Fifteen articles, involving 14 studies, were identified in the SLR and included in the analysis. The estimated rate of severe hypoglycemia (SH) events per patient per year ranged from 0.90 to 1.50 in patients with type 1 DM (T1DM) and from 0.30 to 0.63 in patients with type 2 DM (T2DM). The data on HRU differed extensively between studies, making it difficult to draw a conclusion. Total costs per SH event ranged from €409.97 in patients with T1DM to €713.10 in patients with DM. Work absence was reported in 11.80–18% of the working patients. Further, patients who experienced hypoglycemic events expressed a higher fear and had a poorer QoL than those who did not report these events. Conclusion: Although the data included in the SLR were difficult to synthesize due to heterogeneity of the study designs and patient characteristics in the 14 studies, our search identified a high burden associated with hypoglycemic events in terms of HRU and costs, and patients’ QoL. Further research is recommended to reach a consensus on hypoglycemia definition and study design to provide robust evidence on the burden of hypoglycemia and to accurately weigh the impact of this acute complication in Spain.

Researchers defined dozens of code smell detectors, which exploit different sources of information to support developers when diagnosing design flaws. Despite their good accuracy, previous work pointed out three important limitations that might preclude the use of code smell detectors in practice: (i) subjectiveness of developers with respect to code smells detected by such tools, (ii) scarce agreement between different detectors, and (iii) difficulties in finding good thresholds to be used for detection. To overcome these limitations, the use of machine learning techniques represents an ever increasing research area. Objective: While the research community carefully studied the methodologies applied by researchers when defining heuristic-based code smell detectors, there is still a noticeable lack of knowledge on how machine learning approaches have been adopted for code smell detection and whether there are points of improvement to allow a better detection of code smells. Our goal is to provide an overview and discuss the usage of machine learning approaches in the field of code smells. Method: This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on Machine Learning Techniques for Code Smell Detection. Our work considers papers published between 2000 and 2017. Starting from an initial set of 2456 papers, we found that 15 of them actually adopted machine learning approaches. We studied them under four different perspectives: (i) code smells considered, (ii) setup of machine learning approaches, (iii) design of the evaluation strategies, and (iv) a meta-analysis on the performance achieved by the models proposed so far. Results: The analyses performed show that God Class, Long Method, Functional Decomposition, and Spaghetti Code have been heavily considered in the literature. DECISION TREES and SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES are the most commonly used machine learning algorithms for code smell detection. Models based on a large set of independent variables have performed well. JRIP and RANDOM FOREST are the most effective classifiers in terms of performance. The analyses also reveal the existence of several open issues and challenges that the research community should focus on in the future. Conclusion: Based on our findings, we argue that there is still room for the improvement of machine learning techniques in the context of code smell detection. The open issues emerged in this study can represent the input for researchers interested in developing more powerful techniques. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Code smells; Machine learning; Systematic literature review","Artificial intelligence; Codes (symbols); Decision trees; Heuristic methods; Learning systems; Odors; Code smell; Evaluation strategies; Functional decomposition; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Sources of informations; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Learning algorithms","Azeem, M.I.; Laboratory for Internet Software Technologies, Street No.4, zhongguancun Beijing, China; email: azeem@itechs.iscas.ac.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059611960

Methods A SLR through January 2018 was performed. Research questions were constructed using the Patient, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) format. We included data from articles that reported on each relevant intervention. Summary effect estimates were calculated for direct comparison studies that matched the PICO question exactly, and for studies with the relevant intervention and comparator. When meta-analyses were available, we used these estimates. Results From 7534 retrieved articles (+15 from hand searches), 188 articles were included in the review. In individuals with high-risk antiphospholipid antibody (aPL) profile without prior thrombotic or obstetric APS, two meta-analyses showed a protective effect of low-dose aspirin (LDA) against thrombosis. Two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies showed no additional benefit of treatment with vitamin K antagonists at target international normalised ratio (INR) 3-4 versus INR 2-3 in patients with venous thrombosis. In patients with arterial thrombosis, two RCTs and two cohort studies showed no difference in risk of recurrent thrombosis between the two target INR groups. One open-label trial showed higher rates of thrombosis recurrences in triple aPL-positive patients treated with rivaroxaban than those treated with warfarin. RCTs and cohort studies showed that combination treatment with LDA and heparin was more effective than LDA alone in several types of obstetric APS. SLR results were limited by the indirect evidence and the heterogeneity of patient groups for some treatments, and only a few high-quality RCTs. Conclusion Well-designed studies of homogeneous APS patient populations are needed. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

We applied the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach and identified 23 success factors that influence RCM in GSD projects. The findings of the SLR indicate that change impact analysis, change understanding, management support, RCM process awareness, standard for RCM, progress measure, updated requirements and minimize project failure risk are key factors that influence RCM in a GSD project.

Relationships among authors, co-citations, keywords, and centrality statistics were identified through algorithms for optimizing standard graph layout. This study discusses the results of this relationship for improving the competitiveness of enterprises. The relationships among the authors of the corpus constitute relationships between isolated groups with little connectivity, low density, and a formation of distinct communities. The categories of analysis emerged in the study themes, as well as the techniques adopted to measure the relationships between innovation and private company performance. In the analyzed studies, innovation initiatives converge. Overall, they contribute to improvements in company performance. In the scientific field, initiatives for developing innovations have enhanced the performance of private companies. A key theoretical contribution of this article is in identifying the research corpus on the relationship between innovation and performance in private companies. The practical contribution of this study lies in offering evidence produced by studies that can help decision making regarding the creation of strategies and policies focused on competitiveness.

Methods Data sources/study setting: Review of English-language literature published in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane library (2007-2019). Study design: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the impact of cancer care reforms. Primary endpoints were resource use, cost, quality of care, and clinical outcomes. Data collection/extraction methods: For each study, we extracted and categorized comparative data on the impact of policy reforms. Given the heterogeneity in patients, interventions and outcome measures, we did a qualitative synthesis rather than a metaanalysis. Results Of the 26 included studies, seven evaluations were in fact qualified as quasi experimental designs in retrospect. Alternative payment models were significantly associated with reduction in resource use and cost in cancer care. Across the seventeen studies reporting data on the implicit payment reforms through care coordination, the adoption of clinical pathways was found effective in reduction of unnecessary use of low value services and associated costs. The estimates of all measures in ACO models varied considerably across participating providers, and our review found a rather mixed impact on cancer care outcomes. Conclusion The findings suggest promising improvement in resource utilization and cost control after transition to prospective payment models, but, further primary research is needed to apply robust measures of performance and quality to better ensure that providers are delivering high-value care to their patients, while reducing the cost of care. © 2019 Nejati et al.

The objective was to determine whether sex bias is present in otolaryngology and whether sex is appropriately analyzed as an independent variable in otolaryngology clinical research. Study Design: Literature review. Methods: We systematically reviewed all 2016 articles in three major otolaryngology journals: The Laryngoscope, JAMA Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery, and Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery. Extracted data included study origin, location, subspecialty, number/sex of subjects, ≥50% sex matching (SM ≥50 ), and sex-based statistical analysis. Results: Six hundred of 1,209 articles comprising original clinical research were reviewed including 8,997,345,495 subjects (males: 3,898,559,264 [43.3%]; females: 5,095,592,583 [56.6%]; and unknown: 3,193,648 [0.04%]). There were 533/600 (88.8%) studies that included both sexes, eight (1.3%) included females only, five (0.8%) included males only, and 56 (9.3%) did not document participant sex. Only 280 studies (46.7%) analyzed data by sex, and 330 studies (60.7%) had SM ≥ 50 . Sex-based statistical analysis and SM ≥ 50 were similar in domestic and international studies (48.7% vs. 42.8% and 60.9% vs. 62%, respectively). Database studies performed sex-based statistical analysis more frequently than single and multi-institutional studies (79.1% vs. 40.4% and 43.4%, P &lt;.00001). Analysis by sex was more frequently performed in head and neck surgery (53.6%) and pediatric otolaryngology (51.3%), whereas SM ≥50 was highest in pediatric otolaryngology (86.8%) and otology (82.4%). Conclusions: Sex bias exists in the clinical otolaryngology literature, with less than half the studies analyzing sex. Acknowledging the intertwinement of sex with disease pathophysiology and outcomes is important. Eliminating sex bias in research and clinical care should become a major focus for otolaryngologists.

As there are no head-to-head trials comparing the efficacy of SGLT2is, the primary objective of this analysis was to indirectly compare ertugliflozin to other SGLT2i in patient populations with inadequately controlled glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c > 7.0%) and previously treated with either diet/exercise, metformin alone or metformin plus a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i). Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting outcomes at 24–26 weeks of treatment. Comparators to ertugliflozin were the SGLT2is canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, with non-SGLT2i comparators also evaluated third-line [insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs)]. Outcomes were change from baseline in HbA1c, weight and systolic blood pressure (SBP) as well as HbA1c < 7% and key safety events. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to synthesize evidence. Results are presented as the median of the mean difference (MD) or as odds ratios with 95% credible intervals (CrI). Results: In patients uncontrolled on diet/exercise, the efficacy of ertugliflozin 5 mg monotherapy was not significantly different from that of other low-dose SGLT2is in terms of HbA1c reduction, while ertugliflozin 15 mg was more effective than dapagliflozin 10 mg (MD − 0.36%, CrI − 0.65, − 0.08) and empagliflozin 25 mg (MD − 0.31%, CrI − 0.58, − 0.04). As add-on therapy to metformin, ertugliflozin 5 mg was more effective in lowering HbA1c than dapagliflozin 5 mg (MD − 0.22%, CrI − 0.42, − 0.02), and ertugliflozin 15 mg was more effective than dapagliflozin 10 mg (MD − 0.26%, CrI − 0.46, − 0.06) and empagliflozin 25 mg (MD − 0.23%, CrI − 0.44, − 0.03). Among patients uncontrolled on combination therapy metformin plus a DPP4i, no relevant RCTs with insulin were identified from the SLR. One study with a GLP-1 RA was included in a sensitivity analysis due to limited data. There were no differences between ertugliflozin 5 or 15 mg and other SGLT2is, with the exception of dapagliflozin 10 mg, which was significantly less effective when added to sitagliptin and metformin. Overall, there were no other significant differences for remaining efficacy and safety outcomes except for a lower SBP for canagliflozin 300 mg compared to ertugliflozin 15 mg in the diet/exercise population. Conclusions: Indirect comparisons for HbA1c reduction found that ertugliflozin 5 mg was more effective than dapagliflozin 5 mg when added to metformin monotherapy, whereas ertugliflozin 15 mg was more effective than dapagliflozin 10 mg and empagliflozin 25 mg when added to diet/exercise and to metformin monotherapy. The HbA1c reduction associated with ertugliflozin was no different than that associated with canagliflozin across all populations.

However, the burden of cancer among the US population is not shared equally, with racial and ethnic minorities and lower-income populations having a higher cancer burden compared with their counterparts. For example, African Americans have the highest mortality rates and shortest survival rates for most cancers compared with other racial or ethnic groups in the United States. A wide range of technologies (eg, internet-based [electronic health, eHealth] technologies, mobile [mobile health, mHealth] apps, and telemedicine) available to patients are designed to improve their access to care and empower them to participate actively in their care, providing a means to reduce health care disparities; however, little is known of their use among underserved populations. Objective: The aim of this study was to systematically review the current evidence on the use of cancer-specific patient-centered technologies among various underserved populations. Methods: Computer-based search was conducted in the following academic databases: (1) PubMed (cancer subset), (2) MEDLINE, (3) PsycINFO, and (4) CINAHL. We included studies that were peer-reviewed, published in the English language, and conducted in the United States. Each study was individually assessed for relevance, with any disagreements being reconciled by consensus. We used a 3-step inclusion process in which we examined study titles, abstracts, and full-text papers for assessment of inclusion criteria. We systematically extracted information from each paper meeting our inclusion criteria. Results: This review includes 71 papers that use patient-centered technologies that primarily targeted African Americans (n=31), rural populations (n=14), and Hispanics (n=12). A majority of studies used eHealth technologies (n=41) finding them to be leading sources of cancer-related health information and significantly improving outcomes such as screening among nonadherent individuals and increasing knowledge about cancer and cancer screening. Studies on mHealth found that participants reported overall favorable responses to receiving health information via short message service (SMS) text message; however, challenges were experienced with respect to lack of knowledge of how to text among some participants. More complex mobile technologies (eg, a tablet-based risk assessment tool) were also found favorable to use and acceptable among underserved populations; however, they also resulted in more significant barriers, for example, participants expressed concerns regarding security and unfamiliarity with the technology and preferred further instruction and assistance in its use. Conclusions: There is a growing body of literature exploring patient-centered technology and its influence on care of underserved populations. In this review, we find that these technologies seem to be effective, especially when tailored, in improving patient and care-related outcomes. Despite the potential of patient-centered technologies and the receptivity of underserved populations, challenges still exist with respect to their effective use and usability. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

While the benefits of incorporating multiple types of knowledge in environmental research and management are many, successfully doing so has remained a challenge. In response there has been a number of recent reviews that have sought to better understand the what and how, when it comes to bridging Indigenous and science-based knowledge. Yet there continues to be a need for methods, models, and approaches for integrative work. This systematic map seeks to examine the extent, range, and nature of the published literature (i.e., peer-reviewed and grey) that integrates and/or includes Indigenous and science-based knowledge in coastal-marine research, monitoring, or management in Canada. Results from this study can be used to inform new and ongoing research and monitoring efforts and highlight evidence gaps. Methods: The systematic map will aim to capture all available studies relevant to the question found in the peer-reviewed and grey literature. Accordingly, the search will leverage four databases focused on peer reviewed publications, carefully selected specialist websites, and two web-based search engines. Reference sections of relevant review articles will also be cross-checked to identify articles that were not found using the search strategy. All searches will be conducted in English. Search results will be reviewed in two stages: (1) title and abstract; and (2) full text. All screening decisions will be included in the database. The systematic map will employ a narrative synthesis approach that will include the use of descriptive statistics, tables (including SM database), and figures (including map with the studies geospatially referenced). In addition, an online version of the map and queryable database will be developed similar to other knowledge mobilization tools. © 2019 The Author(s).","Canada; Coastal-marine management; Ecological research; Indigenous knowledge systems, integrative knowledge; Monitoring; Systematic map; Traditional ecological knowledge",,"Alexander, S.M.; Environment and Biodiversity Sciences, Fisheries and Oceans CanadaCanada; email: steven.alexander@dfo-mpo.gc.ca",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",20472382,,,,"English","Environ.

Decision analytic models exist for evaluating the economic ramifications associated with HF. Despite this, studies that appraise these modelling approaches for augmenting best-practice decisions remain scarce. Objective: Our objective was to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of published economic models for the management of HF and describe their general and methodological features. Methods: This SLR employed a combination of relevant search terms associated with HF, which were used in a number of databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, ScHARR Health Utilities Database and Cochrane Library Database. A number of model features (i.e. model structure, specification, outcomes assessed, scenario and sensitivity analysis, key model drivers) were extracted and subsequently summarized. Results: Of 64 publications retained, a selection of modelling approaches were identified, including Markov (n = 28), trial-based analytic (n = 22), discrete-event simulation (n = 6), survival analytic (n = 7) and decision-tree modelling (n = 1) approaches. The bulk of publications employed either a cost-utility (n = 27) or cost-effectiveness (n = 36) analysis and evaluated more than one study outcome, which typically included overall costs (n = 59), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (n = 55), life-years gained (n = 48) and willingness-to-pay thresholds (n = 37). Most publications focused on patients with chronic HF (n = 40) and used New York Heart Association (NYHA) disease classifications to categorize patients and determine disease severity. Few (n = 19) publications documented the use of hospitalization states for modelling patient outcomes and associated costs. A quality assessment of the included publications revealed most articles demonstrated reasonable methodological value. Conclusions: We identified numerous decision analytic modelling approaches for evaluating the cost effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments in HF. A Markov cohort model approach was most commonly used, and most models relied on NYHA classes as a proxy of HF severity, disease progression and prognosis. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"enalapril; eplerenone; ivabradine; ramipril; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; decision tree; disease classification; disease severity; economic evaluation; economic model; health status; heart failure; hospitalization; human; New York Heart Association class; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; Review; simulation; survival; systematic review; treatment outcome; Willingness To Pay; adult; cost benefit analysis; decision support system; disease exacerbation; economic model; economics; heart failure; Markov chain; Adult; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; Decision Trees; Disease Progression; Heart Failure; Humans; Markov Chains; Models, Economic","Globe, G.; Amgen Inc., One Amgen Center DriveUnited States; email: gglobe@amgen.com",,"Springer International Publishing",11707690,,PARME,"30596210","English","Pharmacoeconomics",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059473730

Some of the methodologies being used in industry with time are converted in 'best practices'. This systematic literature review (SLR) focuses on finding what are the software engineering best practices being taught to students in academia. It is expected to show with this SLR what are the best practices being taught and how, so other instructors and the teaching staff can evaluate what to choose and level up their courses to the extent of what is being used and is already tested. To perform this SLR, a well-known protocol was used with the search string: 'software engineering education' and 'best practices' (variations and synonyms of the words were also used), the search was performed in six well-known databases. It is surprising that the amount of primary studies found in this SLR was not what was expected, seventeen primary studies were identified. These studies mentioned a total of seventy best practices that are being used in academia to teach software engineering, some of them are mentioned in more than one paper. But the granularity of the primary studies was quite different some of the best practices are really software engineering best practices and others are instructional best practices. It was also evaluated how the use of these practices was validated and reported, and the results are very diverse, some of them did not have a validation, others have qualitative data, and a few qualitative and quantitative data. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Software engineering; Students; Development technology; Engineering best practice; Qualitative data; Quantitative data; Software industry; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Teaching software; Engineering education",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781538611739,PFECD,,"English","Proc.

However, there is little knowledge on how governments’ deployment of electronic and internet technologies may be leveraged to stimulate sustainable supply chain management, particularly Sustainable Public Procurement (SPP) practices. From a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), this paper affirms such allusions by scholars and reports that government deployment of electronic and internet tools indeed promotes SPP towards the bigger agenda of sustainable development (SDG 12.7). In this paper, 68 articles of heterogeneous research methods published in peer-review journals since 2001–2017 are systematically reviewed. This paper concludes that efforts in building a robust ICT infrastructure, online portals, and human capacity to use ICT offer developing countries inter alia an informative platform for sharing and communicating SPP requirements. E-government also facilitates a wider sample for market readiness assessment and an integrated e-procurement system towards effective SPP monitoring and evaluation. This study has significant implications for promoting sustainability in the downstream supply chain practices in public sector organizations in the developing country context. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Developing countries; e-Government; Public sector e-procurement; Sustainable development; Sustainable public procurement; Systematic literature review","Developing countries; Knowledge management; Planning; Supply chain management; Sustainable development; E-governments; e-Procurement; Monitoring and evaluations; Public procurement; Public sector organization; Sustainable supply chains; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Government data processing; communication network; developing world; governance approach; information and communication technology; Internet; literature review; public sector; supply chain management; sustainable development; article; developing country; government; human; Internet; market; monitoring; organization; peer review; public sector; sustainable development; systematic review","Adjei-Bamfo, P.; Department of Public Administration and Health Services Management, University of Ghana Business School, P.O.

In order to use these algorithms in real-time applications, many flexible hardware architectures have been proposed and implemented with multiple design constraints. Therefore, a systematic study is required to analyze various implementation approaches. This paper has focused on the identification and classification of recent research practices pertaining to the flexible hardware implementation of cryptographic algorithms. We have used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process to identify 51 research articles, published during 2008-2017. The identified researches have been classified according to three design approaches: (1) crypto processor, (2) crypto coprocessor and (3) multicore crypto processor. Consequently, a comparative analysis of various cryptographic algorithms in terms of flexibility, throughput, area, power and implementation technology has been presented. A comprehensive investigation of flexible architectures for implementing cryptographic algorithms facilitates researchers and designers of the domain to select an appropriate design approach for a particular algorithm and/or application according to their needs. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","area; crypto coprocessor; crypto processor; Cryptographic algorithms; flexibility; hardware architectures; literature review; multicore crypto processor; throughput","Coprocessor; Cryptography; Integrated circuit design; Throughput; area; Crypto coprocessor; Crypto-processor; Cryptographic algorithms; flexibility; Hardware architecture; Literature reviews; Hardware security","Rashid, M.; Department of Computer Engineering, Umm Al-Qura UniversitySaudi Arabia; email: mfelahi@uqu.edu.sa",,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

Interventions to increase distress tolerance offer a holistic approach to chronic disease SM and may enhance the individual’s ability to apply SM skills and resources to improve quality of life and overall health. The purpose of this systematic review was to deepen understanding of the relationships among distress tolerance and goal-oriented problem-solving as an aspect of chronic disease SM. Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations were used to develop a search strategy, selection criteria, screening, and identification and extraction procedures. PubMed, CINAHL, PsychInfo, and Scopus were searched from 2006 to December 2017 using the following search terms: distress tolerance, chronic conditions, self-management. Results: Across the 11 studies included in the literature review, there was a high level of heterogeneity in the use of subjective and objective measures to assess distress tolerance, and only one study included instruments to measure goal-oriented problem-solving, the target of distress tolerance interventions that are assumed to influence the selected health outcome. Conclusion: Further research is needed on the efficacy of distress tolerance interventions for improving SM of chronic conditions. Theory-driven interventions that explicate the precise goal-oriented problem-solving and SM behaviors that are expected to change as a result of the distress tolerance intervention will provide insight on the efficacy of the intervention and help close the theory–practice gap. © The Author(s) 2018.","chronic conditions; common themes; healing modalities; specific conditions; stress and coping; stress management/relaxation","chronic disease; complication; coping behavior; human; mental stress; procedures; psychology; quality of life; self care; Adaptation, Psychological; Chronic Disease; Humans; Quality of Life; Self-Management; Stress, Psychological","Starkweather, A.R.; University of ConnecticutUnited States; email: beth.russell@uconn.edu",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",08980101,,,"29788795","English","J.

The field of SPLs and variability have been topics of extensive research over the few past decades. Objective: This research characterizes systematic reviews (SRs) in the field, studies how SRs analyze and use evidence-based results, and identifies how variability is modeled. Method: We conducted a tertiary study as a form of systematic review. Results: 86 SRs were included. SRs have become a widely adopted methodology covering the field broadly otherwise except for variability realization. Numerous variability models exist that cover different development artifacts, but the evidence is insufficient in quantity and immature, and we argue for better evidence. SRs perform well in searching and selecting studies and presenting data. However, their analysis and use of the quality of and evidence in the primary studies often remains shallow, merely presenting of what kinds of evidence exist. Conclusions: There is a need for actionable, context-sensitive, and evaluated solutions rather than novel ones.

Objective: To perform a systematic review of the literature on the role of SM in the treatment of mRCC and discuss key issues in the SM decision-making process. Evidence acquisition: A systematic search of the Embase and Medline databases was carried out and a systematic review of the role of SM in mRCC was performed. A total of 56 studies were finally included in the evidence synthesis. Evidence synthesis: All the studies included were retrospective and mostly noncomparative. Median overall survival (OS) ranged from 36 to 142 mo for those undergoing SM, compared to 8–27 mo for no SM. SM was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to no SM (pooled adjusted hazard ratio 2.37, 95% confidence interval 2.03–2.87; p < 0.001). Morbidity and mortality were similar for SM and primary tumor surgery. The most important prognostic factor for OS was complete resection of metastases. Other prognostic factors included disease free-survival from nephrectomy, primary tumor features (T stage ≥3, high grade, sarcomatoid features, and pathological nodal status), the number of metastases, and performance status. Lung metastasectomy seemed to show the best survival benefit. Conclusions: Although no randomized clinical data are available, published studies support the role of SM in selected patients in the modern era. Complete SM allows sustained survival free of systemic treatment. Integration of SM and systemic therapy in a multimodal approach remains a valid option for some patients. Patient summary: Surgical resection of metastases originating from renal cell carcinoma may play a role in prolonging survival and avoiding systemic therapy when complete resection is achievable. This strategy is an option for selected patients with a limited number of metastases who still have good general health status. Surgical metastasectomy in renal cell carcinoma has potential benefits. It offers prolonged survival in a subgroup of patients with slowly growing disease and allows survival free from medical treatment, thus avoiding treatment-related toxicities. Complete resection is the primary goal in all patients. However, relief of metastases-related symptoms is also an indication for the procedure. Features identifying the best candidates for metastasectomy include achievable complete resection, good performance status, a long disease-free interval (from nephrectomy), and limited metastatic sites, ideally in the lungs. In all cases, the decision should be individualized and closely discussed within dedicated multidisciplinary cancer centers. © 2018","Metastasectomy; Metastases; Renal cell carcinoma; Surgery; Treatment","clinical decision making; female; human; kidney tumor; male; metastasis resection; mortality; nephrectomy; procedures; prognosis; renal cell carcinoma; survival analysis; treatment outcome; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Clinical Decision-Making; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Metastasectomy; Nephrectomy; Prognosis; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome","Ouzaid, I.; Department of Urology, Bichat Claude Bernard Hospital, 46 rue Henri Huchard, France",,"Elsevier B.V.",25889311,,,"31017089","English","Eur.

However, even with their high adaptation rate, the task of performing an SLR requires a large amount of effort and presents a number of barriers. Specifically, during the SLR search phase authors must expend a lot of time and overcome a large number of barriers. Objective: To help alleviate some of the barriers in the search phase, we identify and prioritize SLR search tool requirements based on input from the SLR community. These requirements will help tool builders ensure they focus their efforts appropriately. Method: We conducted an SLR and a survey of SLR authors in software engineering. In the SLR we extracted problems and solutions SLR authors reported during their search processes. In the survey we asked respondents to describe the problems they faced during SLR search and to specify any requirements they would like to see as part of an SLR search tool. We also asked survey respondents to describe any tools they use to support SLR search, along with the strengths and limitations of those tools. Results: Based on analysis of 84 studies from the literature and a qualitative analysis of 131 responses from researchers, we identified a set of functional requirements that authors, researchers, and tool builders can use as a reference. We also describe the tools currently used by SLR researchers. Conclusions: The list of SLR search tool requirements can be used by tool builders as a guide when constructing new tools.

MLRs are useful for both researchers and practitioners since they provide summaries both the state-of-the art and –practice in a given area. MLRs are popular in other fields and have recently started to appear in software engineering (SE). As more MLR studies are conducted and reported, it is important to have a set of guidelines to ensure high quality of MLR processes and their results. Objective: There are several guidelines to conduct SLR studies in SE. However, several phases of MLRs differ from those of traditional SLRs, for instance with respect to the search process and source quality assessment. Therefore, SLR guidelines are only partially useful for conducting MLR studies. Our goal in this paper is to present guidelines on how to conduct MLR studies in SE. Method: To develop the MLR guidelines, we benefit from several inputs: (1) existing SLR guidelines in SE, (2), a literature survey of MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields, and (3) our own experiences in conducting several MLRs in SE. We took the popular SLR guidelines of Kitchenham and Charters as the baseline and extended/adopted them to conduct MLR studies in SE. All derived guidelines are discussed in the context of an already-published MLR in SE as the running example. Results: The resulting guidelines cover all phases of conducting and reporting MLRs in SE from the planning phase, over conducting the review to the final reporting of the review. In particular, we believe that incorporating and adopting a vast set of experience-based recommendations from MLR guidelines and experience papers in other fields have enabled us to propose a set of guidelines with solid foundations. Conclusion: Having been developed on the basis of several types of experience and evidence, the provided MLR guidelines will support researchers to effectively and efficiently conduct new MLRs in any area of SE. The authors recommend the researchers to utilize these guidelines in their MLR studies and then share their lessons learned and experiences. © 2018","Evidence-based software engineering; Grey literature; Guidelines; Literature study; Multivocal literature review; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping study","Information systems; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Grey literature; Guidelines; Literature reviews; Literature studies; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Software engineering","Garousi, V.; Information Technology Group, Wageningen UniversityNetherlands; email: vahid.garousi@wur.nl",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053877709

Despite its importance, finding an economic cost assessment methodology to address disasters of small and large proportions as well as to cover all disaster cost types is a challenge. This study, through a systematic literature review (SLR), offers a taxonomy, a framework and a research agenda for assessing the economic costs of disasters. To meet these goals, 1446 peer-reviewed papers and 2825 grey documents were retrieved and analyzed. The results highlight (i) the use of new technologies (such as social media and crowdsourcing) and pre-defined economic costs indicators for improving the disaster assessment response time; (ii) that there is a lack of usage of economic methods (e.g., econometrics, input-output) within the existing methodologies; (iii) and that there are few publications addressing the economic costs of slow-onset disasters. Also, the proposed framework aims to unify, through a critical analysis of the selected documents, common patterns, best practices, functionalities and actions to obtain an economic assessment independent of type and size of the disaster to be assessed. Finally, this study shows the importance of including grey literature in systematic reviews, as 50% of the selected disaster assessment methodologies came from this source. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cost assessment; Disaster; Economic assessment; Framework; Methodology; Natural hazards",,"Leiras, A.; Industrial Engineering Department, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro - PUC-Rio, Rua Marquês de São Vicente, 225 - sala: 950 L−22453-900, Brazil; email: adrianaleiras@puc-rio.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",22124209,,,,"English","Int.

Even though the use of solar irradiation to generate electricity is currently at a fast deployment pace and technological evolution, its natural variability still presents an important barrier to overcome. Machine learning and data mining techniques arise as alternatives to aid solar electricity generation forecast reducing the impacts of its natural inconstant power supply. This paper presents a literature review on big data models for solar photovoltaic electricity generation forecasts, aiming to evaluate the most applicable and accurate state-of-art techniques to the problem, including the motivation behind each project proposal, the characteristics and quality of data used to address the problem, among other issues. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method was used, in which research questions were defined and translated into search strings. The search returned 38 papers for final evaluation, affirming that the use of these models to predict solar electricity generation is currently an ongoing academic research question.

In the USA alone, there was a 13.2% increase between 2009 and 2012 compared with 2002-2005. There remains a lack of approved treatments to prevent disease progression, leaving many liable to developing complications that include multisystem organ failure (OF) and death. This therapeutic deficit raises questions about the scale of the current burden of illness (BOI) associated with severe forms of AP. The aim of the systematic literature review (SLR) was to assess clinical, humanistic, and economic outcomes associated with moderately severe AP (MSAP) and severe AP (SAP) in the USA and the European Union-5 (EU-5). Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and Embase to identify studies published in English (between 2007 and 2017) that reported on the BOI of MSAP and/or SAP. Manual searches of 'grey' literature sources were also conducted. Results: The SLR identified 19 studies which indicated that 15%-20% of patients with AP progress to more severe forms of the disease, up to 10.5% of those with SAP require surgery for complications, and up to 40% die during hospitalisation. By contrast, there appears to be a lack of data on the extent to which SAP affects patients' quality of life. Conclusion: The available evidence clearly demonstrates that the current management for MSAP and SAP in the USA and EU-5 does not adequately meet patients' needs. Early identification and intervention for AP is crucial, given the evidence of high rates of morbidity and an associated economic burden that is considerable. Since many patients with the condition present to hospitals at a point when multisystem OF or death is highly likely, there is a particularly urgent need for effective treatment options to prevent disease progression. © 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","burden of illness; moderate severe acute pancreatitis; severe acute pancreatitis","acute pancreatitis; age; clinical outcome; comorbidity; disease burden; disease severity; European Union; gender; health economics; human; incidence; medical literature; morbidity; mortality; prevalence; priority journal; quality of life; Review; systematic review; United States","Sarri, G.; Evidence Synthesis, Modeling and CommunicationUnited Kingdom; email: Grammati.Sarri@evidera.com",,"BMJ Publishing Group",20544774,,,,"English","BMJ Open Gastroenterol.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062102295

We aimed to conduct a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of available data on vitamin D status and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in all 83 LMICs. Methods: We followed the general methodology for SLRs in the area of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Highest priority was placed on identifying relevant population-based studies, followed by cross-sectional studies, and to a lesser extent case-control studies. We adopted the public health convention that a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D < 25/30 nmol/L) at > 20% in the entire population and/or at-risk population subgroups (infants, children, women of child-bearing age, pregnancy) constitutes a public health issue that may warrant intervention. Results: Our SLR revealed that of the 83 LMICs, 65% (n = 54 countries) had no published studies with vitamin D data suitable for inclusion. Using data from the remaining third, a number of LMICs had evidence of excess burden of vitamin D deficiency in one or more population subgroup(s) using the above convention (Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Tunisia and Mongolia) as well as possibly other LMICs, albeit with much more limited data. Several LMICs had no evidence of excess burden. Conclusion: Vitamin D deficiency is a public health issue in some, but certainly not all, LMICs. There is a clear need for targeting public health strategies for prevention of vitamin D deficiency in those LMICs with excess burden. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","FAO food balance sheets; Food fortification; Low and lower-middle income countries; Serum 25(OH)D; Systematic review; Vitamin D deficiency","25 hydroxyvitamin D; Afghanistan; Article; cross-sectional study; groups by age; high risk population; human; India; middle income country; Mongolia; Pakistan; pregnancy; public health problem; Tunisia; vitamin blood level; vitamin D deficiency; developing country; procedures; public health; statistics and numerical data; vitamin D deficiency; Developing Countries; Humans; Public Health; Vitamin D Deficiency","Cashman, K.D.; Cork Centre for Vitamin D and Nutrition Research, University College CorkIreland; email: k.cashman@ucc.ie",,"Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag GmbH and Co.

Aforementioned challenges are highlighted when there is a need to transfer knowledge between sites, particularly when software artifacts assigned to different sites depend on each other. The design of the software architecture and associated task dependencies play a major role in reducing some of these challenges. Objective: The current literature does not provide a cohesive picture of how the distributed nature of software development is taken into account during the design phase: what to avoid, and what works in practice. The objective of this paper is to gain an understanding of software architecting in the context of GSD, in order to develop a framework of challenges and solutions that can be applied in both research and practice. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) that synthesises (i) challenges which GSD imposes on software architecture design, and (ii) recommended practices to alleviate these challenges. Results: We produced a comprehensive set of guidelines for performing software architecture design in GSD based on 55 selected studies. Our framework comprises nine key challenges with 28 related concerns, and nine recommended practices, with 22 related concerns for software architecture design in GSD. These challenges and practices were mapped to a thematic conceptual model with the following concepts: Organization (Structure and Resources), Ways of Working (Architecture Knowledge Management, Change Management and Quality Management), Design Practices, Modularity and Task Allocation. Conclusion: The synthesis of findings resulted in a thematic conceptual model of the problem area, a mapping of the key challenges to practices, and a concern framework providing concrete questions to aid the design process in a distributed setting. This is a first step in creating more concrete architecture design practices and guidelines. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Design practice; Global software development; Software architecture; Software design; Systematic literature review","Concretes; Knowledge management; Quality management; Software architecture; Architecture knowledge managements; Concrete architecture; Design practice; Global software development; Software architecting; Software architecture design; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design","Sievi-Korte, O.; Laboratory of Pervasive Computing, Tampere University of Technology, Korkeakoulunkatu 1, P.O.

The present study compared the efficacy of two IV iron formulations in patients with IDA: iron isomaltoside (IIM) and ferric carboxymaltose (FCM). Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IIM and FCM in patients with IDA. An adjusted indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of IIM and FCM was then conducted to evaluate differences in change from baseline hemoglobin and the proportion of patients achieving a clinically-relevant response. Results: The SLR identified no completed RCTs of IIM versus FCM, 5 RCTs of IIM (4 versus oral iron and 1 versus iron sucrose), and 14 RCTs of FCM (11 versus oral iron and 3 versus iron sucrose). In an ITC via iron sucrose, IIM resulted in a significantly larger increase from baseline hemoglobin with a mean difference of +0.249 g/dL with IIM relative to FCM, but there was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with a clinically-relevant response. Conclusions: IIM resulted in a larger increase from baseline hemoglobin than FCM in patients with IDA, but with no difference in the proportion of patients responding.

Several text classification approaches, such as supervised machine learning (SML) or rule-based approaches, have been utilized to obtain beneficial information from free-text clinical reports. In recent years, many researchers have worked in the clinical text classification field and published their results in academic journals. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) has recapitulated the existing primary studies on clinical text classification in the last five years. Thus, the current study aims to present SLR of academic articles on clinical text classification published from January 2013 to January 2018. Accordingly, we intend to maximize the procedural decision analysis in six aspects, namely, types of clinical reports, data sets and their characteristics, pre-processing and sampling techniques, feature engineering, machine learning algorithms, and performance metrics. To achieve our objective, 72 primary studies from 8 bibliographic databases were systematically selected and rigorously reviewed from the perspective of the six aspects. This review identified nine types of clinical reports, four types of data sets (i.e., homogeneous–homogenous, homogenous–heterogeneous, heterogeneous–homogenous, and heterogeneous–heterogeneous), two sampling techniques (i.e., over-sampling and under-sampling), and nine pre-processing techniques. Moreover, this review determined bag of words, bag of phrases, and bag of concepts features when represented by either term frequency or term frequency with inverse document frequency, thereby showing improved classification results. SML-based or rule-based approaches were generally employed to classify the clinical reports. To measure the performance of these classification approaches, we used precision, recall, F-measure, accuracy, AUC, and specificity in binary class problems. In multi-class problems, we primarily used micro or macro-averaging precision, recall, or F-measure. Lastly, open research issues and challenges are presented for future scholars who are interested in clinical text classification. This SLR will definitely be a beneficial resource for researchers engaged in clinical text classification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical text classification; Feature engineering; Performance metrics; Rule-based text classification; Supervised machine learning","Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Clinical research; Information retrieval systems; Information services; Inverse problems; Learning algorithms; Supervised learning; Clinical text classifications; Feature engineerings; Performance metrics; Supervised machine learning; Text classification; Text processing","Mujtaba, G.; Department of Computer Science, Sukkur IBA UniversityPakistan; email: mujtaba@siswa.um.edu.my",,"Elsevier Ltd",09574174,,ESAPE,,"English","Expert Sys Appl",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053829021

It extends connectivity to everyday things, however, such increase in the connectivity creates many prominent challenges. Context: Generally, IoT opens the door for new applications for machine-to-machine and human-to-human communications. The current trend of collaborating, distributed teams through the Internet, mobile communications, and autonomous entities, e.g., robots, is the first phase of the IoT to develop and deliver diverse services and applications. However, such collaborations is threatened by the fragmentation that we witness in the industry nowadays as it brings difficulty to integrate the diverse technologies of the various objects found in IoT systems. Diverse technologies induce interoperability issues while designing and developing various services and applications, hence, limiting the possibility of reusing the data, more specifically, the software (including frameworks, firmware, applications programming interfaces, and user interfaces) as well as of facing issues, like security threats and bugs, when developing new services or applications. Different aspects of handling data collection ranging from discovering smart sensors for data collection, integrating and applying reasoning on them must be available to provide interoperability and flexibility to the diverse objects interacting in the system. However, such approaches are bound to be challenged in future IoT scenarios as they bring substantial performance impairments in settings with the very large number of collaborating devices and technologies. Objective: We raise the awareness of the community about the lack of interoperability among technologies developed for IoT and challenges that their integration poses. We also provide guidelines for researchers and practitioners interested in connecting IoT networks and devices to develop services and applications. Method: We apply the methods advocated by the evidence-based software engineering paradigm. This paradigm and its core tool, the systematic literature review (SLR), were introduced to the software-engineering research community early 2004 to help researchers and industry systematically and objectively gather and aggregate evidences about different topics. In this paper, we conduct an SLR of both IoT interoperability issues and the state-of-practice of IoT technologies in the industry, highlighting the integration challenges related to the IoT that have significantly shifted the landscape of Internet-based collaborative services and applications nowadays. Results: Our SLR identifies a number of studies from journals, conferences, and workshops with the highest quality in the field. This SLR reports different trends, including frameworks and technologies, for the IoT for better comprehension of the paradigm and discusses the integration and interoperability challenges across the different layers of this technology while shedding light on the current IoT state-of-practice. It also discusses some future research directions for the community. © 2014 IEEE.","Internet of Things (IoT); interoperability; models; protocols; standards; technologies and frameworks","Application programming interfaces (API); Application programs; Automation; Biological systems; Computer supported cooperative work; Data acquisition; Data handling; Data structures; Distributed computer systems; Firmware; Interoperability; Machine-to-machine communication; Models; Network protocols; Program debugging; Standards; User interfaces; Wireless sensor networks; Biological system modeling; Collaborative services; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Future research directions; Internet of Things (IOT); Machine to machine (M2M); Services and applications; Systematic literature review (SLR); Internet of things","Aly, M.; SWAT Laboratory, Polytechnique MontréalCanada; email: mohab.aly@polymtl.ca",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",23274662,,,,"English","IEEE Internet Things J.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051049569

With rapid development in mobile technology, mobile health (mHealth) interventions or using a mobile device for TB management has gained popularity. Despite the potential usefulness of mHealth interventions for TB, few studies have quantitatively synthesized evidence on its effectiveness, presumably because of variability in outcome measures reported in the literature. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the outcome measures reported in TB mHealth literature in LMICs. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched to identify mHealth intervention studies for TB (published up to May 2018) that reported any type of outcome measures. The extracted information included the study setting, types of mHealth technology used, target population, study design, and categories of outcome measures. Outcomes were classified into 13 categories including treatment outcome, adherence, process measure, perception, technical outcome, and so on. The qualitative synthesis of evidence focused on the categories of outcome measures reported by the type of mHealth interventions. Results: A total of 27 studies were included for the qualitative synthesis of evidence. The study designs varied widely, ranging from randomized controlled trials to economic evaluations. A total of 12 studies adopted short message service (SMS), whereas 5 studies used SMS in combination with additional technologies or mobile apps. The study populations were also diverse, including patients with TB, patients with TB/HIV, health care workers, and general patients attending a clinic. There was a wide range of variations in the definition of outcome measures across the studies. Among the diverse categories of outcome measures, treatment outcomes have been reported in 14 studies, but only 6 of them measured the outcome according to the standard TB treatment definitions by the World Health Organization. Conclusions: This critical evaluation of outcomes reported in mHealth studies for TB management suggests that substantial variability exists in reporting outcome measures. To overcome the challenges in evidence synthesis for mHealth interventions, this study can provide insights into the development of a core set of outcome measures by intervention type and study design. © Seohyun Lee, Youngji Lee, Sangmi Lee, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful Islam, Sun-Young Kim.","Evidence synthesis; Low-and middle-income countries; MHealth; Outcome measures; Tuberculosis",,"Kim, S.-Y.; Department of Public Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, South Korea; email: sykim22@snu.ac.kr",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,,"English","J.

Unfortunately, the cancer system lags in its systematic provision of self-management support (SMS) in routine care, and it is unclear what implementation approaches or strategies work to embed SMS in the cancer context to inform health policy and administrator decision-making. Methods/design: A comprehensive scoping review study of the literature will be conducted based on methods and steps identified by Arksey and O'Malley and experts in the field. Electronic searches will be conducted in multiple databases including CINAHL, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, AMED, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (up to Issue 2, 2015), ISI Proceedings (Web of Science), PsychAbstracts, and Sociological Abstracts from January 1997 to November 5, 2018. Following the PRISMA-Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), two authors will independently screen all titles/abstracts to determine eligibility, data will be abstracted by one author and checked by a second author, and findings will be narratively summarized based on constructs of implementation in the Normalization Process Theory. Discussion: This will be the first scoping review study to synthesize knowledge of implementation of SMS in the cancer care context and the implementation approaches and strategies on embedding in care. This information will be critical to inform health policy and knowledge end users about the necessary changes in care to embed SMS in practices and to stimulate future research. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cancer; Implementation; Scoping review protocol; Self-management; Self-management support","behavior; cancer care; cancer center; cancer survival; cancer therapy; clinical practice; cognition; consultation; decision making; decision support system; distress syndrome; health care; health care personnel; health care planning; health care policy; health care quality; health program; human; knowledge; malignant neoplasm; mental performance; outcome assessment; patient care; patient education; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; quality of life; reflex; Review; self care; self concept; skill; social support; systematic review; health care delivery; mass communication; methodology; neoplasm; procedures; professional practice; self care; social support; Delivery of Health Care; Diffusion of Innovation; Humans; Neoplasms; Professional Practice; Research Design; Self-Management; Social Support; Systematic Reviews as Topic","Howell, D.; University Health Network (Princess Margaret Cancer Centre), 610 University Ave, Canada; email: Doris.howell@uhn.ca",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",20464053,,,"30704509","English","Syst.

Even though increased availability of databases has facilitated LCA takeoff, assuring data quality is fundamental to ensure meaningful results and reliable interpretation. Methods: Ecoinvent has become a global reference for inventory data. Its current version released three impact partition modeling options—the recycled content, “allocation at the point of substitution” (APOS), and consequential models—whose adequate choice is crucial for yielding meaningful assessments. Tutorials and manuals describe the distribution algorithm that backs each system model, to ground decision-making regarding the best fit to a study’s goals. We performed a systematic literature review to investigate—within the papers published on the International Journal of LCA (IJLCA)—how transparently authors addressed the system model choices. Results and discussion: About 70% of LCA practitioners continued to use earlier versions of ecoinvent after version 3 was launched in 2013. The number of papers using versions 3.x only showed an increased growth trend 2 years later. Eighty-three papers actually adopted the newest version of the database. From those, only 29 papers clearly mentioned the adopted system model. Our SLR also suggests a trend regarding authorship profile of LCA-related studies: the number of studies conducted by practitioners aware of the intricacies of sound modeling of background and foreground data might have been surpassed by those conducted by non-LCA specialists who use LCA as a supporting tool for investigations in applied fields, and merely scratch the surface.

Approaches suggested in the literature may differ in terms of required facilities, possible applications, amount of human intervention required, ability to support multiple users at the same time adapting to changing needs. In this paper, we propose a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that classifies most influential approaches in the area of smart spaces according to a set of dimensions identified by answering a set of research questions. These dimensions allow to choose a specific method or approach according to available sensors, amount of labeled data, need for visual analysis, requirements in terms of enactment and decision-making on the environment. Additionally, the paper identifies a set of challenges to be addressed by future research in the field. © 2019 by the author.","Human habits; Intelligent environments; Modeling; Smart spaces; Survey","Decision making; Internet of things; Models; Surveying; Human habits; Human intervention; Intelligent environment; Internet of Things (IOT); Mining techniques; Research questions; Smart space; Systematic literature review (SLR); Surveys","Leotta, F.; Dipartimento di Ingegneria Informatica, Automatica e Gestionale Antonio Ruberti, Sapienza Università di RomaItaly; email: leotta@diag.uniroma1.it",,"MDPI AG",19995903,,,,"English","Future Internet",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060186857

Model-Driven Development (MDD) is a significant method to cope with this problem and allow the ultimate solution to change management as well. MDD is the next level in harnessing UML and development environments to manage software development. Although researchers have devised many MDD techniques, languages and tools in the domain of mobile application development. Our conjecture to the best of our knowledge is, no research study is available yet that analyzes and summarizes the modern trends, tools and techniques in this context. Therefore, in this article, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that recognizes 30 studies (2013-2018) where MDD is utilized for MAD. This leads to identification of 11 models, and 21 tools. Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis of MDD tools for mobile application is presented.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken to assist in the identification of the most pertinent papers from three publishers: Emerald, Elsevier and Wiley. The literature findings were assessed and presented relative to publication, author and contents as determined by review. Findings: The SLR was conducted using a number of search criteria. A final set of 31 publications were detected for further examination. The characteristics in terms of publications, authors and contents of the extracted publication set were examined and discussed. A total of 35 factors were identified, distributed in five research categories. The frequency of the extracted factors within the publication set was investigated and enabled valuable quantitative and qualitative observations of current trends for SC. Interestingly, all research categories were represented in the top-counted factors, demonstrating a holistic perception of SC. Given the publication set, in most aspects, the research area examined seems to demonstrate features of an emerging field, which is not yet well established. Research limitations/implications: SLR cannot ensure that all pertinent publications were identified, because it was tailored to a number of search criteria, although certain actions were taken to moderate this limitation. However, the outcome adequately identifies trends and offers valuable information and knowledge for SC and its successful implementation. Originality/value: The present study presents a broad list of factors for SC, integrated from a variety of disciplines and stakeholders. The findings, therefore, provide a valuable reference for both construction professionals and practitioners attempting to implement SC.

But, the adoption of GSD is not straightforward, there are various complications allied with it mainly that related to requirements change management (RCM). The aim of this study is to identify project administration related challenges (CHs) that could negatively impact the RCM activities in GSD firms. We have employed systematic literature review (SLR) method in order to investigate the CHs. Using the SLR method, 10 CHs were identified. The identified CHs were categorized into three broad categories based on the size of organizations as small scale organizations (SSOs), medium scale organizations (MSOs) and large scale organizations (LSOs) in the context of GSD. The classification of the CHs was used to provide a clear picture of RCM process, and their respective CHs in organization size prospective. The study also indicated the critical challenges for RCM process implementation using the standards of the factors having a frequency ≥ 50% as critical. Our findings revealed that 3 out of ten CHs are critical for the implementation of RCM process in GSD. We believe that the findings of this paper are helpful in addressing project administration related problems of RCM practitioners in GSD, which is important for the success of GSD firms. © 2018 IEEE.","'global software development (GSD)'; requirements change management (RCM); systematic literature review","Computer programming; Computer science; Electrical engineering; Mathematical techniques; Critical challenges; Global software development; Organization sizes; Process implementation; Quality software; Requirements change; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538679395,,,"English","Int.

However, e-government initiatives face several barriers. One of them is poor usability. To advance quality of usability, literatures indicate that usability evaluation is a key success factor. There are many approaches to conduct usability evaluation. Each of it has advantages and challenges. On the other hand, there are several aspects that must be considered related to usability evaluation in e-government context. It includes large stakeholders and their diversity, extra needs for ethical practices, as well as high privacy. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the right usability evaluation method in e-government. In order to address this issue, a study using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify the suitable usability evaluation methods. There are 519 literatures that have been selected in the initial stage. It was then followed by an extraction process, which produced 22 selected references.

Each one of these parameters contains a variety of factors that trigger liquefaction and have varying degrees of importance. However, estimating accurate and reliable liquefaction-induced hazards requires identification and benchmarking of the most influential factors that control soil liquefaction. Seismic soil liquefaction factors were identified by Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach and analyzed through Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and the Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) methodologies. The ISM model presented the relationships between fifteen seismic soil liquefaction factors and their benchmarking position from higher to lower-level significant factors in hierarchy. MICMAC is used to examine the strength of the relationship between seismic soil liquefaction significant factors based on their driving and dependence power. This research characterizes the identification and benchmarking of the seismic soil liquefaction factors and their relationships. The results show that the factors-duration of earthquake, peak ground acceleration, drainage condition, and standard penetration test (SPT) blow counts-influence seismic soil liquefaction directly and soil type is the governing factor that forms the base of the ISM hierarchy and consequently triggers seismic soil liquefaction. The results provide a more accurate way of selecting significant factors for establishment of seismic soil liquefaction potential and liquefaction-induced hazards risk assessment models. © 2019 by the authors.","Interpretive structural modeling; MICMAC analysis; Seismic soil liquefaction; Significant factors; Systematic literature review approach",,"Qiu, J.-N.; Faculty of Management and Economics, Dalian University of TechnologyChina; email: qiujn@dlut.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",20763417,,,,"English","Appl.

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate text messaging to support STI/HIV prevention and treatment interventions. Methods: We included articles that reported findings from randomized controlled trials (RTCs) involving adults and youth who were at risk of acquiring (or who currently had) a STI and/or HIV, a text message and comparator intervention, and reported provided outcome data on adherence to STI/HIV treatments. Articles were excluded if they were not published in English. We only included studies that have full-text publications so certainty and risk of bias assessments could be performed. Eight databases were searched to retrieve articles published between 1996 and March 2017. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used and certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. Effect estimates were pooled using a random effects model. Results: A total of 35 RCTs were found, 6 of which were considered at low risk of bias. Eight studies found an increased association using text messaging in appointments attended compared to standard care (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.10). Participants receiving text messages had an increase in HIV testing compared to standard care (n = 6; OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.15). Ten text messaging RCTs measuring adherence using micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) pill counts has a non-significant association (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95-1.45) while five studies measuring adherence by self-report was found to be significant (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.28-2.11). Conclusions: The effectiveness of text message interventions is equivocal. While text messaging has the potential to enhance the delivery of STI/HIV interventions, program planners are encouraged to evaluate any SMS intervention to ensure it is achieving the desired result.

To assess the relative merits of immunomodulatory (IMiD)-free treatments, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify relevant randomized controlled trials in patients with RRMM. A network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to assess various IMiD-free regimens, including bortezomib and dexamethasone (Vd)–based treatments, and to explore differences in patient outcomes. The SLR identified 52 articles, from which four trials were ultimately included in the base-case NMA. The NMA showed that daratumumab plus Vd (DVd) provided a significant advantage in prolonging progression-free survival. Similar trends were observed for overall survival and overall response. Across all outcomes, DVd had the highest probability of being the best treatment. These findings suggest that DVd may provide superior clinical outcomes for RRMM patients suitable for IMiD-free regimens. © 2019, © 2019 Janssen.

Method: We performed a systematic literature review using the Pubmed and Scopus databases to retrieve articles published up to December 2015. We analyzed information reported in these publications according to the mobile health (mHealth) evidence reporting and assessment (mERA) checklist, and complemented this work with specific items related to epidemiology, in order to clarify the types of results reported and summarized in this context. Results: Thirty-three articles were selected and reviewed. Each article was related to a different project. Two mERA items were systematically and fully reported, while two others were never reported. Three projects were deployed in very specific zones. Most of the projects were implemented in Africa. Infectious diseases were the elements most monitored. Most projects were based on daily data collection and SMS transmission. Economic assessment was limited to SMS, mobile phone, and implementation costs. Discussion-conclusion: Although suitable for epidemiologic surveillance, the mERA checklist needs further interpretation. The technical and transmission modes of cellular phone use varied greatly from one study to another. No evaluation of the interoperability capabilities of cellular phones with other applications or sub-systems was possible. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cellular phone; data transmission mode; epidemiological surveillance; health information system","communicable disease; consumer attitude; developing country; economics; emergency; geographic mapping; health survey; human; information processing; measurement accuracy; mobile phone; organization and management; procedures; rural health care; text messaging; Cell Phone; Communicable Diseases; Consumer Behavior; Data Accuracy; Data Collection; Developing Countries; Emergencies; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Population Surveillance; Rural Health Services; Text Messaging","Ouedraogo, B.; UMR912 SESSTIM, Faculté de Médecine, 27 Bd Jean Moulin, France; email: ouedbouks@yahoo.fr",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",17538157,,,"28829691","English","Informatics Health Soc.

For instance, they have been executed in distributed and non-distributed projects. In addition, AMs have been implemented in different project fields, such as engineering, medicine, banking, and manufacturing. Consequently, different Agile approaches have been proposed and integrated with other approaches in order to support the increased demand for diverse project environments. In this direction, various authors have examined the process of developing those approaches; however, the focus on explaining evaluation phases is scarce and scattered. Thereore, this study aims to review pertinent literature to identify the key factors and methodologies used to evaluate the proposed approaches in the Agile domain. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology was adopted to identify, evaluate, and interpret all existing studies relevant to the research objective. SLR provides in-depth and more thorough results than an ordinary literature review. Forty-eight studies were selected and analyzed. The results show that applicability, effectiveness, and efficiency are the three most frequently examined evaluation factors, whereas case studies and surveys are the most frequently used research methods in evaluation studies. Factors identified in this review provide the evidence and the opportunity to design instruments or assessment forms that meet the needs of those researchers who are planning to evaluate their proposed Agile approaches. © ExcelingTech Pub, UK.","Agile method; Evaluation factors; Evaluation methodologies; Systematic literature review (SLR)",,,,"ExcelingTech",20513771,,,,"English","Int.

Some studies propose a mature solution, although they do not present data that are more consistent and capable of being evaluated. Other studies are superficial. In addition, few studies have gone through the protocol.

To enhance these, a systematic literature review (SLR) of academic and non-academic literature was conducted on city resilience peer reviews. Thirty-three attributes of resilience are identified, which provides useful insights into how research and practice can inform risk governance, and utilise peer reviews, to drive meaningful change. Moreover, it situates the challenges associated with resilience building tools within risk governance to support the development of interdisciplinary perspectives for integrated city resilience frameworks.

Given that specific methods, processes, and ultimately strategies for software testing involve a large number of specific concepts, it is valuable to have a robust conceptual base, that is, a testing ontology that defines the terms, properties, relationships and axioms explicitly and unambiguously. In order to look for a testing ontology that can be used in a family of testing strategies, in this paper, we investigate, by means of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), primary studies on software testing ontologies. Following an enhanced SLR process of that proposed by Kitchenham, we analyze the resulting twelve documents in the light of a set of research questions and quality criteria. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","SLR; SLR process; Software testing ontology; Testing strategy","Ontology; Quality assurance; Key Issues; Quality criteria; Research questions; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Testing strategies; Software testing","Olsina, L.; GIDIS_Web, Engineering School, UNLPamArgentina; email: olsinal@ing.unlpam.edu.ar","Piattini M.Rupino da Cunha P.Garcia Rodriguez de Guzman I.Perez-Castillo R.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9783030292379,,,"English","Commun.

A blockchain is an immutable append-only ledger maintained by a peer-to-peer network, where the whole network needs to reach a consensus on the transactional data stored on the ledger. With the decentralization nature, the design of IoT and blockchain aligns with each other well. Blockchain has been integrated with the IoT to solve the existing IoT problems. Our research focuses on analyzing the solutions proposed in academia and the methodologies used to integrate blockchain with the IoT. Through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on peer-reviewed, published articles on blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we gather the knowledge on current technical approaches implemented to integrate blockchain into the IoT. Majority of the research in this space is either at a conceptual level or at a very early stage. However, we only found 35 published papers with the real implementation of blockchain in the IoT platforms. We elicit the challenges of the IoT that were being addressed, and the detailed design of the blockchain-based solutions from two perspectives, namely data management and thing management. The evaluation methods and metrics used by those works are also being recorded and analyzed. In addition to the analysis of the literature, we provide our insights on improving the existing solutions and research methodology based on our expertise and experience on the blockchain. © 2013 IEEE.","blockchain; data privacy; identity management systems; Internet of Things","Authentication; Blockchain; Data acquisition; Data privacy; Distributed computer systems; Information management; Peer to peer networks; Evaluation methods; Identity management systems; Internet of thing (IOT); Peer-to-peer paradigm; Research methodologies; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Transactional data; Internet of things","Lo, S.K.; Data61, CSIROAustralia; email: sinkuang.lo@data61.csiro.au",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065928625

It is a situation where the level and work skillset that are available do not match the market demands and the individual does not know how to identify the skills that they have. To deal with this problem, prediction techniques is used to assist in identifying work-appropriate skills for individual. Thus, a systematic literature review (SLR) on predicting work skillsets using prediction techniques is proposed. The aim of this study is to give an overview on the prediction techniques that have been used to predict work skillset and the accuracy of the techniques. We use SLR to identify 383 prediction techniques studies for identifying skills published from 2014 to 2019. As a result, 9 studies report adequate information and methodology according to our criteria and apply. From the studies, classification techniques are used for predicting work skillset. The algorithms used is Random Forest with precision is 99%. From this study, a future study will be conducted by developing a prediction model to help identifying appropriate work skillsets to meet current needs and identifying the levels of skills they have.

Often, people talk about TD as the amount of postponed work but this is just a basic approximation of the concept that includes many aspects that are technical and managerial. If TD is managed properly, it can provide a huge advantage but it can also make projects unmaintainable, if not. Therefore, being able of measuring TD is a very important aspect for a proper management of the development process. However, due to the complexity of the concept and the different aspects that are involved, such measurement it not easy and there are several different approaches in literature. Goals: This work aims at investigating the existing approaches to the measurement and the analysis of TD focusing on quantitative methods that could also be automated. Method: The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach was applied to 331 studies obtained from the three largest digital libraries and databases. Results: After applying all filtering stages, 21 papers out of 331 were selected and deeply analyzed. The majority of them suggested new approaches to measure TD using different criteria not built on top of existing ones. Conclusions: Existing studies related to the measurement of TD were observed and analyzed. The findings have shown that the field is not mature and there are several models that have almost no independent validation. Moreover few tools for helping to automate the evaluation process exist.

A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to summarise the DMT discontinuation data in adults with RRMS and describe the reasons for DMT discontinuation when available. Methods: The SLR was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. English-language publications of approved RRMS DMTs were searched from inception until December 2016 in the following databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-process, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Results: A total of 82 studies met the initial pre-specified criteria of the SLR. After applying additional selection criteria, 24 studies (from 37 publications) remained that reported discontinuation rates as a key objective, with the majority (14 studies) evaluating only injectable DMTs. Data were reported in a qualitative/narrative manner. Conclusion: Few studies specifically investigated treatment discontinuation in RRMS. Particularly with the introduction of new treatment options, this is a critical consideration when selecting DMTs. The most common reasons for discontinuing treatment were adverse events, lack of efficacy, and pregnancy, highlighting the importance of the risk/benefit profile when determining the appropriate therapy for RRMS. © 2019, Touch Briefings.

However, till today, there is no generic and common understanding in terms of assessing the Industry 4.0 readiness for organizations. The purpose of this paper is to identify the key ingredients for assessing Industry 4.0 readiness for organizations, the interrelationships that exist between these readiness factors and how future research should proceed given the research findings. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) methodology of Tranfield et al. (2003) was employed to ensure the replicability and transparency of the review process. Altogether, 68 articles were identified for the final thematic analysis. Findings: The SLR results generated six broad themes of readiness factors. The interrelationship mechanism between these factors was identified. In addition, 17 research propositions were elucidated. Research limitations/implications: Being the first literature review on assessing Industry 4.0 readiness for organizations, it finds 17 research propositions which will give the future researchers a guideline for further research in Industry 4.0. Practical implications: Although Industry 4.0 is the buzzword, very few organizations understand the concept in detail. This paper will help the organizations to identify the factors which they have to asses critically before implementing Industry 4.0 in an organization. Originality/value: Nevertheless, there has been a lot of research on Industry 4.0; this is the first systematic literature to identify the key ingredients for assessing Industry 4.0 readiness for organizations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cyber-physical systems; Industry 4.0; Literature review; Organizations readiness",,"Sony, M.; Namibia University of Science and TechnologyNamibia; email: emailofsony@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14635771,,BQMTF,,"English","Benchmarking",Review,"Article in Press",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060927002

However, secondary studies are time-consuming and require a significant effort from researchers. Goal: This paper aims to identify contributions derived from the adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques in Computer Science SLRs. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study querying well-known repositories and first found 399 studies as a result of applying the search string in each of the selected search engines. Following the research protocol, we analyzed titles and abstracts and applied inclusion, exclusion and quality criteria to finally obtain a set of 17 studies to be further analyzed. Results: The selected papers provided evidence of relevant contributions of the machine learning usage in performing secondary studies. We found that ML techniques have not been applied yet to all the stages of a SLR. Typically, the preferred stage to apply ML in an SLR is the study selection phase (typically the initial phase). For assessing the effectiveness of ML support while performing SLRs, researchers have provided a comparison either across different ML techniques tested or between manual and ML-supported SLRs. Conclusion: There is significant evidence that the use of machine learning applied to SLR activities (especially the study selection activity) in Computer Science is feasible and promising, and the findings can be potentially extended to other research fields. Also, there is a lack of studies exploring ML techniques for other stages than study selection. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AM technology shows several advantages in literature, and its use increases in aerospace, automotive and biomedicine. Time reduction in design-to-manufacturing cycle, customization, capability to generate complex shapes in one piece and ability to imitate low-weight bio-inspired shapes are the strength of designs based on AM. Due to its potentials, major progresses were done in AM, thanks to technology evolution and increased computational power. With regard to AM, voxelization can be defined as part's discretization in hexahedral elements, as done with pixels in 2D image. Voxels are used to speed-up geometry and algebraic manipulation thanks to their inherent advantages. This paper analyses advantages and criticalities of AM and voxel manipulation through a systematic literature review methodology. The analyses are based upon the filtering of a huge amount of publications available in literature up to obtaining the most significant 25 studies published in the last 5 years. The study's main result is the technology gap's identification, i.e. where AM and voxelization still need improvements, thus providing the reader with suggestions about possible further studies. Computer elaboration power and voxel discretization algorithms are suggested being key issues in AM's further development. © AFM, EDP Sciences 2019","Additive manufacturing; Design; Systematic literature review (SLR); Voxel","3D printers; Biomimetics; Algebraic manipulations; Computational power; Design-to-manufacturing; Discretization algorithms; Hexahedral elements; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Technology evolution; Additives","Bacciaglia, A.; Department of Industrial Engineering (DIN), University of Bologna, Viale del Risorgimento 2, Italy; email: antonio.bacciaglia2@unibo.it",,"EDP Sciences",22577777,,,,"English","Mec.

A clear example is the analysis of cocoa beans quality. The increasing interest of computer vision in this area calls for a clear, systematic overview. In this sense, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of computer vision algorithms to determine the quality of fermented cocoa in a six-year period: from 2013–2018. The aim of this review is to identify the techniques or computer vision algorithms used to assess fermentation index of cocoa beans for quality control, as well, the main physical and chemical characteristics of the cocoa beans identified through the computer vision algorithms. The results show that the PLS (Partial Least-Squares) algorithm is the most used for the classification of images in a statistical approach. Also, color is the physical parameter that is commonly identified through artificial vision algorithms. Meanwhile, Fat and pH are the chemical parameters most identified by FT-NIR (Fourier transform near-infrared) technology in conjunction with the chemometric technique. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Computer vision; Computer vision algorithms; Image recognition","Agriculture; Cocoa; Image recognition; Infrared devices; Least squares approximations; Quality control; Chemometric techniques; Computer vision algorithms; Computer vision techniques; Fourier transform near infrared; Partial least square (PLS); Physical and chemical characteristics; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Computer vision","Mite-Baidal, K.; Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Computer Science Department, Agrarian University of Ecuador, Av. 25 de Julio y Pio Jaramillo, P.O.

In general, smart homes are used to control the operations of the home environment and, to automatically adapt it to its inhabitants’ needs. The smart home reasoning system (SHRS) is in charge of determining the automatic control and adaptation operations of the home system. Recently, there has been extensive research concerning different aspects of the SHRS. However, there is a clear lack of systematic investigation targeted at these systems. To close the gap, this paper explores the SHRS domain. For this reason, we applied the systematic literature review (SLR) method by conducting automatic and manual searches on six electronic databases, and in-depth analysis of 135 literature. From the SRL, this paper identifies about 43% of smart homes are designed to provide general home automation services. It also presents twelve major requirements of an SHRS. In addition, the study finds out that 55.5% of the research contributions in SHRS domain are conceptual and, 51.5% of them are based on symbolic artificial intelligence techniques. Further, it characterizes the usage and application trends of different reasoning techniques in smart home domain and, evaluates the major assumptions, strengths, and limitations of the proposed systems in the literature. Additionally, it discusses the challenges of reasoning in ambient assisted living environments. Finally, it underlines in the importance of utilizing hybrid reasoning approaches and the need to handle overlapping, simultaneous and conflicting multiple inhabitants’ activities and goals. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","AAL; Ambient assisted living; Ambient intelligence; Decision support system; Reasoning systems; Smart homes; Systematic literature review","Ambient intelligence; Artificial intelligence; Assisted living; Decision support systems; Intelligent buildings; Ambient assisted living; Artificial intelligence techniques; Electronic database; Reasoning system; Reasoning techniques; Smart homes; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Automation","Mekuria, D.N.; Università Politecnica delle MarcheItaly; email: d.n.mekuria@pm.univpm.it",,"Springer",18685137,,,,"English","J.

These methods ensure the quick delivery of software products with minimal cost and user satisfaction. Though these techniques were initially developed for small developmental teams, certain challenges have been observed when these methods are applied on large scale. However, we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) for the identification of motivators for adopting agile methods on a large scale from a management perspective. Thus, we have identified a total of 21 motivators for adopting agile methods on a large scale from a management perspective. Among these motivators, some were marked as critical motivators depending on variables, e.g., the factors critical in one variable might not be critical in another variable. The factors which were recorded as critical in all variables are strong executive support, agile development environment training and learning, agile development expertise, team competency, and briefing of top management on agile. Furthermore, we also found that the impact of different motivators was different depending on time and place for project manager guidance, i.e., some motivators were most critical in one region while less critical in another. Similarly, some of the motivators were more critical in previous decades but less critical in recent decades because of different improvements in software processes and technologies. These motivators are also analyzed from different angles, i.e., decade-wise and region wise for project managers guidance. The motivators are extracted from a sample of 58 research papers identified via an SLR process. Finally, we have analyzed the identified motivators based on various variables, such as continents and digital libraries. © 2013 IEEE.","adopting agile methodology; agile software development; Large-scale agile; success factors; systematic literature review","Digital libraries; Human resource management; Managers; Personnel training; Agile Methodologies; Agile software development; Large-scale agile; Success factors; Systematic literature review; Software design","Khan, M.S.; Department of Computer Software Engineering, University of Engineering and Technology at MardanPakistan; email: sohail.khan@uetmardan.edu.pk",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062818998

By using these behaviors individually and collectively are of great help to recognize users across social networks. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) has been performed to distinguish 31 papers published during 2010–2018. The idea is to determine user identification categories that are used to classify users. Furthermore, to identify algorithms, models, methods, and tools that has been suggested since 2010 for user characterization. We have identified 10 algorithms, 19 models, 5 methods and 8 tools that have proposed for 5 user identification categories.

It primarily attempts to provide a comprehensive overview of literature related to corporate bankruptcy prediction, to investigate and address the link between the different authors (co-authorship), and to address the primary models and methods that are used and studied by authors of this area in the past five decades. Design/methodology: A systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted, using the Scopus database for identifying core international academic papers related to the established research topic from the year 1968 to 2017. Findings: It has been verified, firstly, that bankruptcy prediction in the corporate world is a field of growing interest, as the number of papers has increased significantly, especially after 2008 global financial crisis, which demonstrates the importance of this topic for corporate firms. Secondly, it should be mentioned that there is little co-authorship in this researching area, as researchers with great influence were barely working together during the last five decades. Thirdly, it has been identified that the two most frequently used and studied models in bankruptcy prediction area are Logistic Regression (Logit) and Neural Network. However, there are many other innovative methods as machine learning models applied in this field lately due to the emerging technology of computer science and artificial intelligence. Originality/value: We used an approach that allows a better view of the academic contribution related to the corporate bankruptcy prediction; this serves as the link among the different elements of the concept studied, and it demonstrates the growing interest in this area. © Intangible Capital, 2019.","Bankruptcy prediction; Business failure; Default firm; Financial distress; Insolvency; SLR",,,,"OmniaScience",20143214,,,,"English","Intang.

To better understand how these applications can be developed for web browsers, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) composed by two searches for scientific articles, one regarding how multi-projection systems can be implemented using web browsers (which selected 10 articles), and another one regarding how interaction devices besides mouse and keyboard can be used in web browsers (which selected 26 articles); their results were then compiled under the mantle of multi-projected I3DIV applications for web browsers. Results show, among other things, that multi-projection systems for the web are most commonly implemented using client-server and decentralized graphic clusters, that diversified interaction devices are most commonly accessed in web browsers using an approach we called ""device-server-browser"", and that there is currently only one software resource that can be used to develop multi-projected I3DIV applications for web browsers, however it also has limitations regarding usage and, possibly, performance. We conclude then that there is a gap for a resource that addresses these subjects in a more appropriate way. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

These GSD challenges are mainly concerned with requirements to change management (RCM). RCM plays a key role in the successful execution of software projects. The objective of this paper is to identify the best practices of the RCM process by adopting a systematic literature review (SLR) and validate them using questionnaire survey with industry experts. A total of 46 best practices were identified through SLR and validated with industry experts. We have further classified the identified practices in the domain of client and vendor GSD organizations with the aim to provide a clear understanding of the RCM best practices in the context of both types of GSD organizations (client, vendor). Moreover, we have conducted a comparison analysis between SLR and questionnaire survey data and found a moderate positive correlation in the ranks of both data sets (rs = 0.522, p=0.003). In addition, the criticality of the identified best practices was assessed using the criteria of a practice having frequency ≥50%. The findings of this paper provide a framework that could help the GSD organizations to address the problems related to RCM in GSD environment. © 2013 IEEE.","best practices; client; empirical investigation; Global software development (GSD); requirements change management (RCM); systematic literature review (SLR); vendor","Surveys; Best practices; client; Empirical investigation; Global software development; Requirements change; Systematic literature review (SLR); vendor; Software design","Sang, J.; Key Laboratory of Dependable Service Computing in Cyber Physical Society, Ministry of Education, Chongqing UniversityChina; email: jsang@cqu.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068250967

The purpose of the paper is to craft communication model that promotes routine information availability and accessibility by simplifying the approach to organisational communication through the leadership level, functional level and operational level. Methodology: The study applied systematic literature review (SLR) or systematic research synthesis (SRS) as the approach to gather data, analyse to address the research query. The study method embraces the definition of SLR by Rousseau et al. (2008). The conditions for literature search electronically was done through multiple journal sites. The gathered published material dated between 1961-2018. Main Findings: The paper put forward three propositions to establish the argument for organisational communication. The findings show that there is no definitive agreement what constitute organisational communication as it is given many names like internal communication, employee communication, corporate communication etc. There is total lack of structural approach to organisational communication. Applications of this study: The paper refocuses organisational communication towards a three-tier approach and challenges leadership to communicate in tandem with managerial roles as purported by Mintzberg in order to give prominence to organisational communication. Novelty/Originality of this study: The paper introduces three new dimensions as measures of organisational communication with a new perspective on leadership communication, where Mintzberg’s managerial roles were used as reference for leadership communication responsibility which is missing in today’s organisation.

Centered on employees as the focus of the argument regarding how genuinely employee empowerment is realistically practiced in organizations today. Methodology: The study applied systematic literature review (SLR) or systematic research synthesis (SRS) as the method to gather, analyze and respond to the research query. The study method embraces the definition of SLR by Rousseau et al., (2008). The conditions for the literature search electronically were done through multiple journal sites. The gathered academic published materials were dated between 1954-2017. Main Findings: The findings revealed that there is a misconception surrounding the true picture of employee empowerment in organizations. Different organizations have different interpretations of employee empowerment as deem fitting to serve their needs. Most findings propagate employee empowerment on the conditions of internal factors of the organization. Applications of this study: This new approach to employee empowerment will give employees a new lease of life that extends beyond the immediate influence of the organization. It incorporates external factors as both define and shape the attitude and behaviors of employees. Both micro and macro factors relating to work roles and non-work roles of employees matter in empowerment. Novelty/Originality of this study: This study takes a holistic approach to employee empowerment by taking both inside-out and outside-in approach to factors that have strong influence on the attitude and behavior of employees thus relates to performance. It introduces new measures for employee empowerment. © Badjie et al.","Employee empowerment; Empowering; Empowering employees; Empowerment; Organizational performance",,,,"Gyandhara International Academic Publications",23956518,,,,"English","Humanit.

However, BPM techniques are often criticized for their inability to deal with continuous and significant change and uncertainty. Following recent calls to make BPM more agile and flexible towards change, this study presents the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) of agile concepts in BPM. Analysing and synthesising previous works and drawing on agility research in the field of IS, this paper introduces a framework for agile BPM. Integrating different components that define agility in the context of BPM, this framework offers a number of important implications. On the theoretical side, the authors argue that the concept of agile BPM departs in some important ways from traditional BPM research. This, in turn, points to various opportunities for future research. On the practical side, the authors suggest that emerging technologies, such as process mining, embody important features that help organisations to be more responsive to change. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: To assess the state of the art of agility in the BPM research, the authors conducted an SLR. More specifically, the authors drew on the approach of vom Brocke et al. (2009, 2015), which consists of five steps: defining the scope of the review; conceptualising the topic; searching for literature; analysing and synthesising literature; and developing a research agenda. Findings: This study presents the results of a systematic review of agile concepts in BPM. This study then proposes a resulting research framework that can be used to strengthen the concept of agile BPM and provides an agenda for research in this rapidly growing and increasingly necessary area of BPM. Originality/value: In this paper, the authors establish a shared understanding of agile BPM and develop an agile BPM framework that represents the current state as well as implications for research and practice in agile BPM. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive BPM; Agile business process management; BPM agility; BPM framework; Literature review",,"Badakhshan, P.; Institute of Information Systems, Universitat LiechtensteinLiechtenstein; email: peyman.badakhshan@uni.li",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14637154,,,,"English","Bus.

SOP is an emerging strategy and is different from ordinary software development outsourcing (SDO). Usually, a fruitful outsourcing association might be converted to an outsourcing partnership. Conversely, SOP is not a risk-free business, numerous barriers associated with SOP. The overarching target of this exploratory paper is to find and analyze a list of barriers that are considered obstacles for vendors in the conversion of their surviving contractual outsourcing relationship to a partnership. Firstly, twenty-six barriers to SOP formation were identified through systematic literature review (SLR) from a sample of 106 papers and then an empirical survey was conducted with fifty experts to analyze the significance and applicability of these barriers in the SOP context. The identified barriers were further analyzed based on five variables such as decades, company size, continents, location of analysis, and perspective of the study. Ten barriers were considered as critical barriers (CBs) via SLR. Industrial experts indicate they extremely agree with five CBs. Eight CBs were equally reported on all continents. We found ten CBs common in all types of organizations. Further, twelve CBs were shared in both decades while ten CBs were found common in both academia and industry. Furthermore, four CBs were specific to clients; five were specific to vendors while ten were common to both. The association of various barriers with SOP formation is found statistically significant for twenty-five barriers with effect size (0.41 < O < 0.90, p < 0.05). Stakeholders in SOP should address all the listed barriers especially the critical ones to attain a partner position. © 2013 IEEE.","empirical survey; software outsourcing partnershipclient-vendor relationship; Systematic literature review","Electric circuit breakers; Mergers and acquisitions; Software design; Surveys; Client-vendor relationships; Empirical surveys; Outsourcing partnership; Outsourcing relationships; Software development outsourcings; Software outsourcing; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Outsourcing","Huang, J.; Department of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Petroleum-BeijingChina; email: huangjw@cup.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075788462

In order to gain profit or fame, usually spam reviews are written to promote or demote a few target products or services. This practice is known as review spamming. In the past few years, a variety of methods have been suggested in order to solve the issue of spam reviews. In this study, the researchers carry out a comprehensive review of existing studies on spam review detection using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. Overall, 76 existing studies are reviewed and analyzed. The researchers evaluated the studies based on how features are extracted from review datasets and different methods and techniques that are employed to solve the review spam detection problem. Moreover, this study analyzes different metrics that are used for the evaluation of the review spam detection methods. This literature review identified two major feature extraction techniques and two different approaches to review spam detection. In addition, this study has identified different performance metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of the review spam detection models. Lastly, this work presents an overall discussion about different feature extraction approaches from review datasets, the proposed taxonomy of spam review detection approaches, evaluation measures, and publicly available review datasets. Research gaps and future directions in the domain of spam review detection are also presented. This research identified that success factors of any review spam detection method have interdependencies. The feature's extraction depends upon the review dataset, and the accuracy of review spam detection methods is dependent upon the selection of the feature engineering approach. Therefore, for the successful implementation of the spam review detection model and to achieve better accuracy, these factors are required to be considered in accordance with each other. To the best of the researchers' knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of existing studies in the domain of spam review detection using SLR process. © 2019 by the authors.","Fake review; Opinion spam; Review spammer detection; Spam review detection",,"Mirza, H.T.; Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad, Lahore CampusPakistan; email: drturab@cuilahore.edu.pk",,"MDPI AG",20763417,,,,"English","Appl.

The objective of this work is to improve the decision-making process by increasing the quality of information related to energy indicators in the food industry. This research involves developing a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify energy efficiency indicators in the food industry, which serve as inputs for a sectoral evaluation based on multicriteria techniques. The SLR identified six criteria evaluated by food industry experts, which form the proposed basis for evaluating the performance of related sectors. These criteria are: benchmarks, key performance indicators, framework, monitoring, ISO 50001, and information communication technologies (ICTs) in sectoral evaluations. The criteria were evaluated by experts using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which prioritizes the most important food industry issues using an evaluation scale. Weights were attributed to each issue and positioned according to the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) to evaluate each sector by the identified criteria. The evaluated criteria are applicable to the three sectors surveyed, with emphasis on the beverage sector. Among the evaluated criteria, ICTs were highlighted by Industry 4.0 as a concern for the food sector. © 2019 Instituto de Tecnologia do Parana.","Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Energy efficiency; Food industries; Manufacture; Preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE)",,"Pradella, A.M.; Pontifical Catholic University of Paraná (PUCPR), Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate ProgramBrazil; email: angelapradella@gmail.com",,"Instituto de Tecnologia do Parana",15168913,,,,"English","Braz.

Workflow applications have a complex structure and many discrete tasks. Each task may include entering data, processing, accessing software, or storage functions. For these reasons, the workflow scheduling is considered to be an NP-hard problem. Then, efficient scheduling algorithms are required for selection of best suitable resources for workflow execution. In this paper, we conduct a SLR (Systematic literature review) of workflow scheduling strategies that have been proposed for cloud computing platforms to help researchers systematically and objectively gather and aggregate research evidences about this topic. Then, we present a comparative analysis of the studied strategies. Finally, we highlight workflow scheduling issues for further research. The findings of this review provide a roadmap for developing workflow scheduling models, which will motivate researchers to propose better workflow scheduling algorithms for service consumers and/or utility providers in cloud computing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,,"Yassir, S.; National School of Computer Science and Systems Analysis, Mohamed V UniversityMorocco; email: yassir.samadi@um5s.net.ma",,"Springer",23673370,,,,"English","Lect.

However, the poor performance of supply chain management has been identified as a pivotal reason for low uptake of OSM. We believe that there are no significant reports on research that addresses the theoretical development of Housing-Offsite Manufacturing-Supply Chain Management (HOSCM). A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out to identify the critical issues related to supply chain management in HOSCM research. Around 39 journal articles spanning from 1996 to 2017 (as of October), addressing HOSCM research, were selected. Around eighty-two issues were identified after an in-depth content analysis with reference to principal component bodies of Supply Chain Management (SCM), entity of analysis, level of analysis, elements of exchange and OSM type. Identified issues were clustered under similar themes named as HOSCM constructs as weak demand, product customization, inappropriate strategy setting, stakeholder repositioning, lack of customer focus, dynamic relationships, varied stakeholder engagement, slow organizational learning, imbalance risk distribution, local environment adaptation, lack of knowledge sharing, poor communication, lack of technology utilization, financial fragility, lack of logistic integration, and inadequate performance measurement.

Publishing is not enough: to transcend it is necessary to be cited. However, the issue is complex and requires attention on several points; one of them is the strategies of visibility that allow future citations. This systematic literature review (SLR) aims to analyze articles about citation impact, published between 2016 and 2018, filed on Scopus and Web of Science databases, to identify visibility strategies for scientific literature. The paper focuses on three aspects: the context and type of studies, the strategies used, and recommendations to increase citation impact in open access journals. Among the findings, it is possible to highlight the use of the Internet for visibility because of its tools. Also, the article recommends different strategies to be replicated in this type of publications. © 2019 Ediciones Universidad de Salamanca.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out an SLR by selecting, extracting, analysing and critically appraising relevant literature that met pre-specified criteria by using transparent, well-organised and replicable steps. The main sources are publications in peer-reviewed journals regardless of their impact factor because the topic of incorporating sustainability in project management practices is restrained by a lack of research. Findings: Based on the analysis, it seems that incorporating sustainability into project management may support project success. However, more evidence is required to support this finding as there are too few relevant empirical studies in the literature. Research limitations/implications: Therefore, considering sustainability as a new school of thought in project management is premature, and there are recommendations for further research at the end of this study. There are several limitations to the studies chosen, which may have significantly affected results, and thus may affect outcomes in this study. Originality/value: Project success needs to be the main endeavour when incorporating sustainability into project management, and it should be a key criterion when considering sustainability as a new school of thought in managing projects. The most challenging elements of project success that need to be addressed are cost and time. This study contributes to a better understanding of the impact of PSM on project success. It facilitates decision making in considering sustainability as a new school of thought in project management. Furthermore, it defines a need for more research work in this potential paradigm shift in managing projects. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Project; Project management; Project success; Project sustainability management; Sustainability; Triple-bottom line",,"Al-edenat, M.; Department of Business, Faculty of Wellbeing and Social Sciences, University of BoltonUnited Kingdom; email: mohaabmalek@yahoo.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",02621711,,,,"English","J.

Recently, new studies have appeared presenting quality assurance methods (QA) for assessing the instructional design in MOOCs with pedagogical innovations, like those implementing active learning pedagogies (e.g. collaboration, gamification), which provide designers and instructors with useful strategies in order to design more interactive MOOCs. However, it is not that clear how these efforts are being addressed and up to which point are appropriate to assess active learning pedagogies. Therefore, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify the most mature existing MOOC QA methods. Afterwards, an evaluative case study was carried out, based on the Evaluand-oriented Responsive Evaluation Model (EREM), to apply the selected methods to a MOOC implementing active learning pedagogies. As the results suggest, the instruments of the selected QA methods need enrichment to assess effectively the instructional design based on active learning pedagogies, by providing specific questions proper for this kind of MOOCs or, by stating the underlying pedagogical model clearly so that the designers could consider beforehand if it is appropriate or not for their case. The results of the study are a first step to define new, enriched quality assessment methods for MOOCs that apply active learning approaches. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

Despite enthusiastic discussions regarding the issue in different spheres, not enough is known about the real potential of online participation and its effectiveness in the political decision-making process. This article proposes a critical analysis of citizen participation on online platforms, their social and political characteristics and consequences. Two systematic literature reviews (SLR) are conducted on case studies-the first one exclusively in Brazil and the second one on cases all over the world-using the Web of Science, Scopus and DOAJ databases, between 1995 and 2015. Primary results indicate a significant growth in participatory platforms in Brazil and the world, however with more rhetorical than practical effects: the majority of the initiatives are promoted by top-down style governmental electronic portals, with little or no influence in the real decision-making process. This article concludes that power-and not technology-is the key obstacle for effective online citizen participation, whose barriers are nurtured by a traditional political elite with little interest in building a transparent, inclusive and collaborative democracy. A new research agenda is suggested to develop public information transparency indicators-methods to measure the social and political impact of the governmental online platforms-as well as investment in empirical studies about civil society initiatives that could promote solutions for the problems, side effects and contradictions intrinsic to online political participation. © 2019 University of Minho, Communication and Society Research Centre.","Democracy; Meta-synthesis; Online platforms; Political participation; Systematic literature review (SLR)",,,,"University of Minho, Communication and Society Research Centre",16452089,,,,"English","Comunica.

However, the development of business process models from textual requirements through existing BPML’s is a time consuming task. In this context, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are commonly applied to automatically generate business process models from textual requirements. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a well-known BPML. This article comprehensively investigates modern techniques, tools and trends for the generation of BPMN models from textual requirements by utilizing NLP techniques. Particularly, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed to select and evaluate 36 research studies published in the span of 2010–2018. As a result, 11 NLP and 8 BPMN tools are identified. Furthermore, 8 commonly generated BPMN constructs are recognized. Finally, a comparative analysis of NLP and BPMN tools is performed with the help of important evaluation parameters. It is concluded that the existing NLP techniques and tools significantly simplify the process of BPMN models generation from textual requirements. However, the existing approaches are inadequate to be applied in the industries, especially for real-time systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","BPML; BPMN; Business process model and notation; Natural language processing; NLP","Interactive computer systems; Modeling languages; Real time systems; Software design; Systems engineering; BPML; BPMN; Business process model; Business process model and notation (BPMN); Business process modeling languages; Development community; Evaluation parameters; Systematic literature review (SLR); Natural language processing systems","Maqbool, B.; Department of Computer & Software Engineering, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences and TechnologyPakistan; email: bilal.maqbool16@ce.ceme.edu.pk","Kim K.J.Kim K.J.Baek N.","Springer Verlag",18761100,9789811310553,,,"English","Lect.

Mobile devices are becoming an integral part of daily life. Nowadays it is very much difficult and tricky to use the mobile application. A task like sending data from one application to another application is too much difficult. Normal people who use these mobile applications, sometimes they feel difficult to use them. Hence, there is a clear point that visually impaired people need much more efforts to use these applications. In the past years, there are many types of research try to improve the mobile application for visually impaired people. All the mobile applications produced from these researches are focusing in technocentric approach, in which they ignore the analysis of actual needs from visually impaired people. In order to improve the quality of mobile application for visually impaired people, the UCD interfaces are more valuable. It can provide more freedom for visually impaired people to perform their daily tasks. It is really helpful for visually impaired people who access their needs with minimum physical and mental effort, and least effect on their natural activity. This paper provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the present studies on UCD interface of mobile application for visually impaired people. The first aim is to identify current problems facing by visually impaired people when using the mobile applications. The second aim is to summarize the possible solutions to resolve the problems facing by visually impaired people when using the mobile applications. The third aim is to find the problem in UCD interface of mobile application manufacturing. This research will also beneficial for future research in UCD interface of a mobile application for visually impaired people. UCD of a mobile application can bring marvelous changes in the life of visually impaired people. These interfaces and new strategies expected to improve the quality of life for visually impaired people. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Human-computer interaction; Mobile application; Systematic Literature Review; User interface; Visual impairment; Visually impair","Facings; Human computer interaction; Mobile computing; Software design; User interfaces; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); User Centered Design(UCD); Visual impairment; Visually impair; Visually impaired people; User centered design","Wong, D.H.-T.; Razak Faculty of Technology and Informatics, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: doriswong@utm.my","Stephanidis C.Antona M.","Springer",18650929,9783030307110,,,"English","Commun.

Studies have shown that consultation to decision time, defined as the time when a consultation has been accepted by a specialty service to the time when disposition decision is made, is one important contributor to the overall length of stay in the ED. The primary objective of this review is to evaluate the impact of workflow interventions on consultation to decision time and ED length of stay in patients referred to consultant services in teaching centres, and to identify barriers to reducing consultation to decision time.Methods This systematic review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. An electronic search was conducted to identify relevant studies from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL databases. Study screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were carried out by two independent reviewers.Results A total of nine full text articles were included in the review. All studies reported a decrease in consultation to decision time post intervention, and two studies reported cost savings. Interventions studied included short messaging service (SMS) messaging, education with audit and feedback, standardization of the admission process, implementation of institutional guideline, modification of the consultation process, and staffing schedules. Overall study quality was fair to poor.Conclusions The limited evidence suggests that audit and feedback in the form of SMS messaging, direct consultation to senior physicians, and standardization of the admission process may be the most effective and feasible interventions. Additional high-quality studies are required to explore sustainable interventions aimed at reducing consultation to decision time.

This paper characterises PLM as a research domain through the themes and clusters of a decade of scientific literature. Authors’ keywords from 1,390 research papers published from 2005 to 2015 are analysed. The co-occurrence of these 2,947 normalised authors’ keywords, connected in pairs via 11,289 edges, indicates how PLM research themes relate to each other to form communities – or clusters. These communities are revealed by filtering the network according to the weights of the network’s edges. The PLM core cluster, the PLM global cluster and the PLM overall cluster are distinguished based on the level of filtering, thus unveiling increasing levels of detail. The four major communities composing the PLM global cluster are ‘interoperability’, ‘ontology’, ‘product data management’ and ‘lifecycle assessment’. The PLM overall cluster also reveals the ‘intelligent product’ community, which relates to the Industry 4.0 phenomenon. The BIM community is revealed as well, but remains isolated from the PLM overall cluster.

ERP systems achieve this by automating and incorporating business processes and data sharing through the organisation and enabling access of information in a real-time environment. These systems mitigate the complexity and the scale of the system implementation process which can result in failures and implementation difficulties. An Information System (IS) is included as a component of an ERP system designed to provide useful information that supports business strategy, business operations, business management analysis and decision making functions. The main purpose of this study focuses on the challenges that occur prior to and post the ERP implementation process in manufacturing organizations over a period of time. The present study adopts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach to gain a comprehensive view of the various research methods and finding, evaluating and synthesizing research. The findings for the present study reveals the lack of various elements that includes top management support, clear vision and goals, organizational culture and user training, departmental collaboration, re-alignment of strategy, project management. It also confirms the high customization of ERP system, incorrect selection of ERP vendor, and poor planning. This paper provides an in depth understanding with respect to ERP systems. It improves business processes including marketing plans and product development decisions.

Treatment options are limited, and their efficacy in randomized trials is poor, whilst outcomes in clinical practice remain unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the real-world effectiveness and tolerability of SCLC treatments. Methods An SLR was conducted across nine databases accessed through OVID, capturing observational, non-randomized studies published between 01/2006–11/2018. In total, 554 abstracts were retrieved and systematically screened for eligibility. The eligible publications included effectiveness and tolerability data from adult SCLC patients (at any line of therapy). Additional grey literature searches were conducted. Results Forty-three publications were included in this review—data from first-line therapies were captured most often (n = 32), while data from second (n = 14) and third line (n = 7) and beyond (n = 7) were less frequent. The publications reported primarily on chemotherapy/ radiotherapy. The majority of publications lacked robustness and only 14/43 conducted statistical analyses or controlled for bias. Median OS for the largest SCLC populations were 9.6 months at first line (n = 23,535) and 4.9 months at second line (n = 254) for treatment with chemotherapy, and 4.7 months at third line (n = 120) for predominantly platinum-based chemotherapy or cyclophosphamide/adriamycin/vincristine. Hematologic toxicities (such as neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and anemia) were the most frequently reported TRAEs (n = 9). Conclusions Real-world treatment effectiveness and tolerability data were fragmented and inconsistently reported, and available publications were primarily of poor quality and lacked statistical analyses. This SLR showed limited treatment options and poor OS in SCLC, with no treatment option being clearly superior. TRAEs additionally increased the burden of this already challenging disease. Recent data suggest real-world outcomes are even poorer that those reported in clinical trials, and that novel therapies are needed to offer new treatment options for patients. © 2019 Povsic et al.

The high HE rate increased researchers’ attention towards Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) and HE assessment approaches. In these approaches, various environmental and individual factors influence the performance of maintenance operators affecting Human Error Probability (HEP) with a consequent variability in the success of intervention. However, a deep analysis of such factors in the maintenance field, often called Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs), is still missing. This has led the authors to systematically evaluate the literature on Human Error in Maintenance (HEM) and on the PSFs, in order to provide a shared PSF taxonomy. Design/methodology/approach: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify and select peer-reviewed papers that provided evidence on the relationship between maintenance activities and human performance. The obtained results provided a wide overview in the field of interest, shedding light on three main research areas of investigation: methodologies for human error analysis in maintenance, performance shaping factors and maintenance error consequences. In particular, papers belonging to the area of PSFs were analysed in-depth in order to identify and classify the PSFs, with the aim of achieving the PSF taxonomy for maintenance activities. The effects of each PSF on human reliability were defined and detailed. Findings: A total of 63 studies were selected and then analysed through a systematic methodology. 46% of these studies presented a qualitative/quantitative assessment of PSFs through application in different maintenance activities. Starting from the findings of the aforementioned papers, a PSF taxonomy specific for maintenance activities was proposed. This taxonomy represents an important contribution for researchers and practitioners towards the improvement of HRA methods and their applications in industrial maintenance. Originality/value: The analysis outlines the relevance of considering HEM because different error types occur during the maintenance process with non-negligible effects on the system. Despite a growing interest in HE assessment in maintenance, a deep analysis of PSFs in this field and a shared PSF taxonomy are missing. This paper fills the gap in the literature with the creation of a PSF taxonomy in industrial maintenance. The proposed taxonomy is a valuable contribution for growing the awareness of researchers and practitioners about factors influencing maintainers’ performance. © 2019, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting incidence of Nd:YAG capsulotomy in patients with monofocal IOLs were identified for systematic literature review (SLR) using Cochrane methodology. A network meta-analysis was conducted under a Bayesian framework. Mean hazard ratios (HRs), 95% credible intervals, and one-sided p-values were estimated for Nd: YAG capsulotomy incidence by comparing AcrySof IOLs with a group of non-AcrySof hydrophobic acrylic, hydrophilic acrylic, silicone, and PMMA IOLs. Sensitivity analysis was conducted comparing the risk of Nd:YAG capsulotomy between sharp- and round-edged designs of the above IOLs. Results AcrySof IOLs had a lower risk of Nd:YAG capsulotomy compared to hydrophobic acrylic (HR: 2.68; 95% CrI: 1.41, 4.77; p < 0.01), hydrophilic acrylic (HR: 7.54; 95% CrI: 4.24, 14.06; p < 0.001), PMMA (HR: 3.64, 95% CrI: 1.87, 6.33; p < 0.001), and silicone (HR: 1.13; 95% CrI: 0.59, 1.91; p <0.1) IOLs. The risk for Nd:YAG was highest among sharp-edged IOLs for hydrophilic acrylic IOLs (HR: 9.32; 95% CrI: 4.32, 19.29; p < 0.01), followed by other hydrophobic acrylic (HR: 2.91; 95% CrI: 1.27, 5.88; p < 0.01), silicone (HR: 0.838; 95% CrI: 0.328, 1.74; p = 0.69), and PMMA (HR: 0.39; 95% CrI: 0.042, 1.49; p = 0.93) IOLs, compared to AcrySof. Acrysof IOLs had a lower risk of Nd:YAG compared to PMMA (HR: 3.25; 95% CrI: 1.21, 7.37; p < 0.01) and silicone, round edge IOLs (HR: 3.84; 95% CrI: 1.08, 10.64; p = 0.015). Conclusion The risk of Nd:YAG capsulotomy is lower in eyes implanted with AcrySof IOLs compared to non-AcrySof hydrophobic or hydrophilic acrylic IOLs.

METHODS: An electronic literature search first identified abstracts published from 2008-2018 inclusively referencing sleep, TBI, and military personnel from Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and Persian Gulf veterans. Selection criteria eliminated studies on non-combat TBI, open or penetrating injuries, and articles where the relationship between sleep and TBI was not directly examined. Articles on all military branches and components, those currently serving and veterans - ranging from medical chart reviews to clinical trials, were included. Forty-one articles were selected for full text-review. RESULTS: Twenty-four papers estimated the prevalence of sleep disturbances in TBI. Eight studies demonstrated the contribution of common co-occurring conditions, most notably posttraumatic stress disorder, to the relationship between disrupted sleep and TBI. Ten studies differentiated sleep profiles between military SMs and veterans with and without acute TBI and detected significant differences in sleep disturbances across the course of injury. Longitudinal studies were scarce but helped to establish the temporal relationship between sleep disturbances and TBI and isolate sleep-related mechanisms influencing TBI prognosis. Only three studies reported on interventions for improving sleep quality and TBI symptoms. Systematic research testing assessments and interventions that target sleep disturbances for improving sleep, TBI symptoms, and long-term functional outcomes were identified as critical knowledge gaps. CONCLUSION: Findings unequivocally establish that sleep disturbances are highly prevalent in SMs and veterans with TBI. However, studies testing the effectiveness of treatments for improving sleep in military groups with TBI have been limited and their results inconsistent.

As a result, manufacturers face a high variety of products, small batch sizes and frequent changeovers. To cope with these challenges, an appropriate level of flexibility of the assembly system is required. A methodology for quantifying the flexibility level of assembly workstations could help to evaluate (and improve) this flexibility level at all times. That flexibility model could even be integrated into the standard workstation design process. Despite the general consensus among researchers that manufacturing flexibility is a multi-dimensional concept, there is still no consensus on its different dimensions. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) shows that many similarities can be found in the multitude of flexibility dimensions. Through a series of interactive company workshops, we achieved to reduce them to a shortlist of 9 flexibility dimensions applicable to an assembly workstation. In addition, a first step was taken to construct a causal model of these flexibility dimensions and their determining factors, the so called drivers, through the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach. In the next phase, a driver scoring mechanism will be initiated to achieve an overall assembly workstation flexibility assessment based on the scoring of drivers depending on the workstation design. © 2019 The Authors.

Healthcare systems are also facing digital transformations with the enhancement in the utilization of healthcare information systems, electronic records in medical, wearable, smart devices, handheld devices, and so on. A bulk of data is produced from these digital transformations. The recent increase in medical big data and the development of computational techniques in the field of cardiology enables researchers and practitioners to extract and visualize medical big data in a new spectrum. The role of medical big data in cardiology becomes a challenging task. Early decision making in cardiac healthcare system has massive potential for dropping the cost of care, refining quality of care, and reducing waste and error. Therefore, to facilitate this process a detailed report of the existing literature will be feasible to help the doctors and practitioners in decision making for the purpose of identifying and treating cardiac diseases. This detailed study will summarize results from the existing literature on big data in the field cardiac disease. This research uses the systematic literature protocol as presented by Kitchenham et al. The data was collected from the published materials from 2008 to 2018 as conference or journal publications, books, magazines and other online sources. 190 papers were included relying on the defined inclusion, exclusion, and checking the quality criteria. The current study helped to identify medical big data features, the application of medical big data, and the analytics of the big data in cardiology. The results of the proposed research shows that several studies exist that are associated to medical big data specifically to cardiology. This research summarizes and organizes the existing literature based on the defined keywords and research questions. The analysis will help doctors to make more authentic decisions, which ultimately will help to use the study as evidence for treating patients with heart related diseases. © 2013 IEEE.","analytics in cardiology; Big data; big data features; healthcare; systematic literature review (SLR)","Big data; Cardiology; Decision making; Digital devices; Health care; Heart; Information use; Medical computing; Computational technique; Data feature; Digital transformation; Global communication systems; Health care information system; Journal publication; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Medical information systems","Nazir, S.; Department of Computer Science, University of SwabiPakistan; email: snshahnzr@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073595195

The research presented here is a stepping stone in order to investigating the existing building portfolio and the conducted analysis. It is used to get further information on what is included and where there is lack of information, in order to understand what is missing or what is needed to develop CE design strategies. Although, life cycle assessment (LCA) is increasingly used by the industry to assess these aspects, the lack of a systematic analytical approach as well as the high building complexity and diversity between buildings limits generalised knowledge from these studies. However, it is assumed that there are certain commonalities between the existing portfolio of prevailing building typologies which can be deducted. The study at hand is a part of a larger research project that aims at developing industry specific tools to support designers and decision makers select CE design strategies that improve the environmental performance and resource consumption of buildings. On the basis of a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of whole building LCAs the paper at hand aims at tracing the environmental impact origin within the existing building portfolio of prevailing building typologies. To identify potentially important building parameters relevant to the resulting environmental impact performance and resource consumption of different building typologies. Based on 39 building LCA case studies that matched the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria of the SLR a focus on global warming and climate change was detected. It was found that even though buildings have different characteristics (size, typology, storeys, reference study period and location), for most of the buildings' environmental impacts were predominantly related to the production of structurally important concrete components e.g. The structural frame, the external envelope, floor slabs and walls. To point towards which CE design strategies should be used to improve the environmental performance of buildings; the environmental information from the studies was insufficient due to lack of detailed information. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Material and methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) on ultrasound-detected finger soft tissue oedema was performed. Subsequently, based on the SLR, a Delphi survey was developed and circulated among a group of 13 expert sonographers, in order to obtain agreement on detection, definition and scoring of finger oedema by B-mode and power Doppler ultrasound. Agreement was considered achieved when each statement was approved by >75% of participants. Results: At the first Delphi round, 91 % agreement was obtained for the scanning technique to adopt, including the most appropriate area to evaluate. At the second round, 76% agreement was achieved on the definition of soft tissue finger oedema. At the third round, 76% agreement was obtained for B-mode and power Doppler scores. The volar aspect of the finger and comparisons with the contralateral side were agreed to be the most appropriate in terms of scanning technique. Agreed ultrasound definition of finger soft tissue oedema was “abnormal hypoechoic/anechoic areas, diffused or localized within the subcutaneous tissue between the epidermidis and the tendon-related anatomic structures (i.e. flexor tendon sheath, peritenonium, tendon pulleys), with local thickening, with or without local abnormal Doppler signal, visualised in two perpendicular planes and not evident on the contralateral side”. Semiquantitative (0-3) scores for both B-mode and power Doppler were agreed to be the most appropriate to be used. Conclusion: Our work produced, for the first time, technical indications, definition and scoring for the ultrasound assessment of soft tissue oedema in psoriatic dactylitis. © 2019 Societatea Romana de Ultrasonografie in Medicina si Biologie.

However, there are important handicaps in ART processes from the point of view of quality, safety and management. On the one hand, these processes are mainly based on manual execution tasks and manual control tasks. This excess of manual tasks could lead to fatal traceability and safety errors during BSM. On the other hand, ART processes require real, interoperable and traceable communications between different software systems that have to collaborate together (health information systems, biological sample management systems, patient management systems, etc.), but, at present, it is possible to identify some limitations in this domain, that is, the domain of systems of systems (SoS). This paper aims to conduct an exhaustive study was carried out both in the research community and in the commercial field to identify and analyze SoS solutions and theoretical proposals for BSM in ART processes. We have applied the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology to carry out our study and we conclude it is a very young research line that shows a growing trend and that in the actuality there are very few technologies that deal with the problem of the BSM in ART.After analyzing the results, this paper presents as future work an initial Model-Driven conceptual solution to improve BSM in ART. © 2019 River Publishers","Assisted Reproductive Treatment; Biological Sample Management; Systematic Literature Review; Systems of Systems",,,,"River Publishers",15409589,,,,"English","J.

Two Cochrane systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have reported that topical treatments for dry mouth and dry eye are safe and effective. Ocular cyclosporine A was safe and effective in two RCTs including 1039 patients with dry eye syndrome. Two Cochrane SLRs on serum tear drops and plugs showed inconsistency in possible benefits, both for symptoms and objective measures. Five RCTs reported significant improvements in oral dryness and salivary flow rates for pilocarpine and cevimeline. An RCT showed no significant placebo-differences for hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day for the primary outcome (visual analogue scale (VAS) composite of dryness, fatigue and pain). We identified seven RCTs carried out in primary SjS patients. RCTs using infliximab, anakinra and baminercept found no placebo-differences for the primary outcomes. The two largest RCTs randomised 255 patients to receive rituximab or placebo and reported no significant results in the primary outcome (VAS composite), while prospective studies suggested efficacy in systemic disease. Conclusion The current evidence supporting the use of the main topical therapeutic options of primary SjS is solid, while limited data from RCTs are available to guide systemic therapies. © 2019 Author(s).","multidisciplinary team-care; Sjøgren's syndrome; treatment","abatacept; alpha interferon; anakinra; artificial tear; baminercept; belimumab; cevimeline; cyclosporine; diquafosol; epratuzumab; etanercept; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; infliximab; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pilocarpine; rituximab; saliva substitute; serum tear; tacrolimus; unclassified drug; biological therapy; drug efficacy; drug safety; dry eye; human; immunosuppressive treatment; lacrimal gland; meta analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; salivation; Sjoegren syndrome; systematic review; systemic therapy; topical treatment; visual analog scale; xerostomia; adverse event; clinical trial (topic); disease management; multimodality cancer therapy; procedures; Sjoegren syndrome; treatment outcome; Clinical Trials as Topic; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease Management; Humans; Sjogren's Syndrome; Treatment Outcome","Ramos-Casals, M.; Laboratory of Autoimmune Diseases Josep Font, CELLEX, IDIBAPSSpain; email: mramos@clinic.cat",,"BMJ Publishing Group",20565933,,,"31749986","English","RMD Open",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074397775

However, in the digitally connected world the organisation is increasingly challenged to protect personal data and there is greater potential for inappropriate data use or disclosure, which can result in legal, financial, and reputational consequences for the organisation. Developments brought about by digital transformation increase the requirement for more stringent approaches to personal data protection to be implemented by the organisation. In most countries, data protection is taken very seriously and enforced through strict regulations (e.g. GDPR) which every organisation who holds personal data must adhere to. However, high-profile data breaches continue to occur. Research suggests that data protection controls have not kept pace with the degree to which organisations are experimenting with digital technologies and the unprecedented data volumes. Many organisations are unable to detect when or where their data systems have been breached. In order to comply with regulatory requirements to protect personal data and avoid potentially significant legal, financial, and reputational implications of a data breach, many organisations must improve their personal data protection approaches. This paper presents the key components or ‘capability building blocks’ of a conceptual framework in the area of Personal Data Protection (PDP) within the organisational context. This framework was developed based on the findings or themes that emerged from a systematic literature review (SLR) in this area followed by an open innovation approach. The resultant conceptual framework can be used by organisations to undertake a holistic analysis of their personal data protection capability. The framework also includes a set of POMs (Practices, Outcomes and Metrics) which acts as a roadmap for organisations to improve upon their current level of maturity in this area to effectively protect personal data and to demonstrate that the organisation is a trustworthy data custodian. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

Methods: The method of nominal groups and Delphi was followed, and supported by a systematic literature review (SLR). A multidisciplinary panel of 12 experts in pain management was selected. In the first nominal group meeting, the aim, scope, users, and sections of the consensus document, were defined, along with the preliminary general recommendations. For the SLR, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as the search strategies, were defined. Two reviewers selected and analysed the articles. This evidence was discussed in a second nominal group meeting, and definitive recommendations were developed. For each recommendation, the evidence levels and grade of recommendation grades were classified according to the Oxford model, and the grade according to the Delphi technique. It was defined as an agreement if at least 70% of the participants scored ≥ 7 for each recommendation (1 = total disagreement to 10 = total agreement). Results: A total of 20 recommendations were produced, which covered general aspects, such as the assessment of pain, and those specific to P/T management. These latter included the indications of the P/T combination (patient profile, dosing, prescription, formulations), risk management (contraindications, precautions, interactions, concomitant use with other medications, follow-up, special situations), and patient education. Conclusions: These recommendations attempt to resolve any of the routine clinical questions, and help in the making of decisions on the use of the P/T combination in patients with moderate-intense pain. © 2018 Sociedad Española de Médicos de Atención Primaria (SEMERGEN)","Pain; Paracetamol; Recommendations; Tramadol","analgesic agent; paracetamol; paracetamol plus tramadol; tramadol; Delphi study; drug combination; human; pain; pathophysiology; practice guideline; severity of illness index; Acetaminophen; Analgesics; Delphi Technique; Drug Combinations; Humans; Pain; Severity of Illness Index; Tramadol","Samper Bernal, D.; Servicio Anestesia, Clínica del Dolor, Hospital Germans Trias i PujolSpain; email: dsamperb@gmail.com",,"Ediciones Doyma, S.L.",11383593,,,"30686297","English; Spanish","Semergen",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055665602

A need exists to better understand the active components required for effective self-management support, how these might be delivered within primary care, and the training and system changes that would subsequently be needed. Objectives (1) To examine self-management support interventions in primary care on health outcomes for a wide range of diseases compared to usual standard of care; and (2) To identify the effective strategies that facilitate positive clinical and humanistic outcomes in this setting. Method A systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating self-management support interventions was conducted following the Cochrane handbook & PRISMA guidelines. Published literature was systematically searched from inception to June 2019 in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligible studies assessed the effectiveness of individualized interventions with follow-up, delivered face-to-face to adult patients with any condition in primary care, compared with usual standard of care. Matrices were developed that mapped the evidence and components for each intervention. The methodological quality of included studies were appraised. Results 6,510 records were retrieved. 58 studies were included in the final qualitative synthesis. Findings reveal a structured patient-provider exchange is required in primary care (including a one-on-one patient-provider consultation, ongoing follow up and provision of self-help materials). Interventions should be tailored to patient needs and may include combinations of strategies to improve a patient’s disease or treatment knowledge; independent monitoring of symptoms, encouraging self-treatment through a personalized action plan in response worsening symptoms or exacerbations, psychological coping and stress management strategies, and enhancing responsibility in medication adherence and lifestyle choices. Followup may include tailored feedback, monitoring of progress with respect to patient set healthcare goals, or honing problem-solving and decision-making skills. Theoretical models provided a strong base for effective SMS interventions. Positive outcomes for effective SMS included improvements in clinical indicators, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy (confidence to self-manage), disease knowledge or control. An SMS model has been developed which sets the foundation for the design and evaluation of practical strategies for the construct of self-management support interventions in primary healthcare practice. Conclusions These findings provide primary care professionals with evidence-based strategies and structure to deliver SMS in practice. For this collaborative partnership approach to be more widely applied, future research should build on these findings for optimal SMS service design and upskilling healthcare providers to effectively support patients in this collaborative process. © 2019 Dineen-Griffin et al.

The importance of studies about mobile communications has been growing increasingly over the last years. This growth is connected to the increase in the access to contents through new devices. The last ten years have seen a process of acceleration in mobile technology innovations. The peak of this new scenario has been the interest of the research community in investigating the relationship between such innovations and the spread of informative contents. This article analyses those studies that address the relation between mobile devices and communication and journalism. The main objective is to clarify the cur rent state of these studies as well as to define their significance within the current convergence scenario. In order to reach such objectives, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. The authors analysed 199 research articles published between January 2008 and May 2018 in the database Web of Science.

Therefore, it is necessary to address what should be considered by requirements engineers in the elicitation and specification phases of embedded systems. However, understanding embedded systems and their environment is a strenuous activity. Hence, requirements engineers need to know the core concepts related to ES and also a systematic guide to consider these concepts in the development process. [Goal] This paper presents a metamodel based on a systematic literature review (SLR) that can support the elicitation of ES concepts. Additionally, we used the metamodel as a guide to the development of a requirements elicitation process. [Method] We used the studies of an SLR as a basis for the metamodel development and their concepts as input for an investigation of actions that are suitable to be used in our elicitation process. The proposed metamodel concepts were evaluated by a domain expert, and we applied the actions of the process to elicit requirements of an infusion pump system. [Results] The metamodel has 118 entities that represent the RE concepts for ES, and the elicitation process has 49 actions to guide requirements identification and definition. [Conclusion] The metamodel can be used by practitioners to check if they are eliciting the appropriate information for the development of embedded systems. Moreover, it can assist future research.

Software architects are challenged to design a framework for developers to write the software only once, but obtaining various implementations of the same application, each one developed with a different programming language. A unique roadmap and different extension-methods are relevant to add allies, to reduce the cost of maintenance and for ease the upgrading. A transpiler is a tool that allows the translation of a source code to other programming languages, so it could be used for this objective.ObjectivesTo make a comprehensive literature review of the studies on transpiler implementations and usages for transaction-oriented applications to clearly identify current works in this topic and guide future work.MethodA Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. In total, of 550 collected papers, 170 primary studies were selected, reviewed, and analyzed.ResultsWe identified that the most common usages for transpilers are for translating sequential to parallel programming, GPU parallel execution optimizations and for compilation improvements.ConclusionThe transpilers have not been used previously for designing multi-platform transaction-oriented applications, opening this field for future research. © 2018 IEEE.","cross compiler; Software Architecture; Source to Source Compiler; Systematic Literature Review; Transcompiler; Transpiler","Computer programming languages; Parallel programming; Product design; Program compilers; Program translators; Software architecture; Translation (languages); cross compiler; Source to Source Compiler; Systematic literature review; Transcompiler; Transpiler; Application programs",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538666579,,,"English","IEEE Ecuad.

It's called HDD because its steering ability to avoid existing utilities or other obstacles either horizontally, vertically and even pulled back where she got its name. HDD was developed in California in the 1970s and was introduced in Europe in 1986. Since year 1992 up to 2016 there are about 40 thousand unit HDD machine were sold worldwide. Contractors, consultants, municipalities and decision makers are always in difficulties to determine the installation cost and the duration required when using the HDD method due to the presence of many qualitative factors. Understanding the HDD productivity factors will assist the stakeholders to overcome this matter. The aims of this study are to identify the existing HDD productivity factors, identify the factors that affect HDD productivity, identify the current tools that are used by current researcher, and identify the open problems and areas related to HDD productivity for improvement. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried to previous related papers retrieved by a manual search, critically analysed and discussed. Researches regarding HDD productivity conducted by previous researchers were compared and discussed. The studies involved journal articles, conference papers, books, guidelines and etc. Consequently, these previous experiences and models can assist the contractors, consultants, municipalities and decision makers in preparing their costing and scheduling. The lacking factors on HDD productivity factors were highlighted and suggested for futre studies. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Contractors; Decision making; Directional drilling; Engineering education; Infill drilling; Productivity; Conference papers; Horizontal directional drilling; Installation costs; Journal articles; Productivity factors; Qualitative factors; Systematic literature review (SLR); Trenchless technologies; Horizontal drilling","Salleh, M.N.; Department of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM SerdangMalaysia; email: norizam32@yahoo.com.my","Jamaludin N.Siat@Sirat Q.A.Ibrahim I.S.Mahamad Anuar U.H.Mohd Yunus N.Z.Abdullah M.H.Ahmad I.S.Awang Ismail D.S.Yaacob H.","EDP Sciences",2261236X,,,,"English","MATEC Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059166386

This emerging trend is focused in content-related challenges: mainly creation (Authoring), adaptation (Context-Awareness) and improvement (Interaction-Analysis) of augmented content. Research in these techniques has enabled Academia to recognise Augmented Reality capability for knowledge transfer, either from AR systems to users or between users. But to the best of author's knowledge, there are no specific literature review in these areas, neither on their relations with AR knowledge transfer ability. Therefore, this paper aims to identify these relations through an analysis of state-of-the-art techniques in Authoring (A), Context-Awareness (CA) and Interaction-Analysis (IA) in the context of maintenance applications. In order to do so, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been conducted on 74 application-relevant papers from 2012 to 2017. It comprised a thematic analysis to establish the relation between maintenance applications, research in A, CA and IA and AR knowledge transfer modes. Its results helped to classify AR maintenance-applications by technological readiness levels. They also revealed the potential of AR for users’ knowledge capture, and future research required for full knowledge management capabilities.

Innovations are increasingly triggered by software embedded in automotive, transportation, medical-equipment, communication, energy, and many other types of systems. To test embedded software in an effective and efficient manner, a large number of test techniques, approaches, tools and frameworks have been proposed by both practitioners and researchers in the last several decades. Objective: However, reviewing and getting an overview of the entire state-of-the-art and the –practice in this area is challenging for a practitioner or a (new) researcher. Also unfortunately, as a result, we often see that many companies reinvent the wheel (by designing a test approach new to them, but existing in the domain) due to not having an adequate overview of what already exists in this area. Method: To address the above need, we conducted and report in this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) in the form of a systematic literature mapping (SLM) in this area. After compiling an initial pool of 588 papers, a systematic voting about inclusion/exclusion of the papers was conducted among the authors, and our final pool included 312 technical papers. Results: Among the various aspects that we aim at covering, our review covers the types of testing topics studied, types of testing activity, types of test artifacts generated (e.g., test inputs or test code), and the types of industries in which studies have focused on, e.g., automotive and home appliances. Furthermore, we assess the benefits of this review by asking several active test engineers in the Turkish embedded software industry to review its findings and provide feedbacks as to how this review has benefitted them. Conclusion: The results of this review paper have already benefitted several of our industry partners in choosing the right test techniques / approaches for their embedded software testing challenges. We believe that it will also be useful for the large world-wide community of software engineers and testers in the embedded software industry, by serving as an “index” to the vast body of knowledge in this important area. Our results will also benefit researchers in observing the latest trends in this area and for identifying the topics which need further investigations. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Embedded software; Embedded systems; Software testing; Systematic literature mapping; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping","Domestic appliances; Embedded software; Embedded systems; Mapping; Testing; Body of knowledge; Review papers; State of the art; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic mapping; Test engineers; Test techniques; Software testing","Garousi, V.; Information Technology Group, Wageningen UniversityNetherlands; email: vahid.garousi@wur.nl",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050473678

Many challenges are adding pressure on the current agriculture supply chains that include shrinking land sizes, ever increasing demand for natural resources and environmental issues. The agriculture systems need a major transformation from the traditional practices to precision agriculture or smart farming practices to overcome these challenges. Geographic information system (GIS) is one such technology that pushes the current methods to precision agriculture. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of 120 research papers on various applications of big GIS analytics (BGA) in agriculture. The selected papers are classified into two broad categories; the level of analytics and GIS applications in agriculture. The GIS applications viz., land suitability, site search and selection, resource allocation, impact assessment, land allocation, and knowledge-based systems are considered in this study. The outcome of this study is a proposed BGA framework for agriculture supply chain. This framework identifies big data analytics to play a significant role in improving the quality of GIS application in agriculture and provides the researchers, practitioners, and policymakers with guidelines on the successful management of big GIS data for improved agricultural productivity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture supply chain; Big data analytics; Drones; GIS analytics; Internet of things; Smart farming","Ball grid arrays; Big data; Drones; Internet of things; Knowledge based systems; Precision agriculture; Productivity; Site selection; Supply chains; Agricultural productivity; Agriculture systems; Big Data Analytics; Environmental issues; Future perspectives; Smart farmings; Successful management; Systematic literature review (SLR); Geographic information systems; agricultural application; agricultural management; agricultural production; data acquisition; farming system; Internet; literacy; literature review; policy making; precision agriculture; resource allocation; supply chain management; trend analysis","Gunasekaran, A.; School of Business and Public Administration, California State University, Bakersfield, 9001 Stockdale Highway, 20BDC/140, United States; email: agunasekaran@csub.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",01681699,,CEAGE,,"English","Comput.

Methods A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed in key electronic databases (1946-2017) comprising an update of an SLR in rheumatology and a hierarchical SLR in other medical fields. Data on the type of workforce prediction models and the factors considered in the models were extracted. Key general as well as specific need/demand and supply factors for workforce calculation in rheumatology were identified. The workforce prediction risk of bias tool was developed and applied to existing workforce studies in rheumatology. Results In total, 14 studies in rheumatology and 10 studies in other medical fields were included. Studies used a variety of prediction models based on a heterogeneous set of need/demand and/or supply factors. Only two studies attempted empirical validation of the prediction quality of the model. Based on evidence and consensus, the newly developed risk of bias tool includes 21 factors (general, need/demand and supply). The majority of studies revealed high or moderate risk of bias for most of the factors. Conclusions The existing evidence on workforce prediction in rheumatology is scarce, heterogeneous and at moderate or high risk of bias. The new risk of bias tool should enable future evaluation of workforce prediction studies.

The objective of these European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR points to consider (PTC) is to guide future workforce studies in adult rheumatology in order to produce valid and reliable manpower estimates. Methods The EULAR Standardised Operating Procedures were followed. A multidisciplinary task force with experts including patients with rheumatic diseases from 11 EULAR countries and the USA was assembled. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to retrieve workforce models in rheumatology and other medical fields. PTC were based on expert opinion informed by the SLR, followed by group discussions with consensus obtained through informal voting. The level of agreement with the PTC was voted anonymously. Results A total of 10 PTC were formulated. The task force recommends models integrating supply (=workforce available in rheumatology), demand (=health services requested by the population) and need (=health services that are considered appropriate to serve the population). In general, projections of workforce requirements should consider all factors relevant for current and future workload in rheumatology inside and outside of direct patient care. Forecasts of workforce supply should consider demography and attrition of rheumatologists, as well as the effects of new developments in healthcare. Predictions of future need/demand should take demographic, sociocultural and epidemiological development of the population into account. Conclusion These EULAR-endorsed PTC will provide guidance on the methodology and the parameters to be applied in future national and international workforce requirement studies in rheumatology. © © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.","Arthritis; Epidemiology; Health services research","Article; attitude to health; community integration; demography; health care manpower; health care need; health care personnel management; health care planning; health service; human; patient care; practice guideline; prediction; rheumatic disease; rheumatologist; rheumatology; social status; systematic review; treatment planning; United States; workforce","Dejaco, C.; Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Medical University GrazAustria; email: christian.dejaco@gmx.net",,"BMJ Publishing Group",20565933,,,,"English","RMD Open",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058345877

There are various approaches for estimation of traditional software development. But mobile applications are considered different from traditional software such as those running on desktop, laptop or on the web. Many traditional estimation techniques used for this software are adapted to mobile domain. With agile software development (ASD) methodology, the scenario of development and estimation has changed drastically and so as mobile app development and estimation. This paper provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on traditional estimation techniques and agile estimation techniques applied in mobile software/application.

This article offers a systematic review of the SG-IPV and SM-IPV (SGSM-IPV) directionality literature, including calculating weighted and unweighted prevalence rate estimates, as well as a critical assessment of methodological limitation and IPV motivation research. Findings indicate that, while approximately half of those who experience an SGSM-IPV relationship have both used and received abusive tactics-similar to findings in the literature on different-gender IPV and IPV in the relationships of heterosexuals-labeling this as ""mutual abuse"" may mask complexities in the data, including, but not limited to a dearth of relationship-level analysis, a lack of standardization in how SGSM-IPV is operationalized, and newly emerging research on the prevalence of self-defense as a motive in bidirectional SGSM-IPV.

Methods: The 6 more interesting topics about axSpA patient profiling were identified by the project steering committee and a panel of axSpA Italian experts. A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed for each of the selected topics according to the PICO format. Two rounds of a modified Delphi process were conducted. In the 1st round, the steering committee evaluated the results of the SLR in order to formulate statements for each topic. In the 2nd round, the experts panel discussed, rephrased when needed, and voted the level of agreement (on a 5-point Likert-type scale) for each statement. Consensus was defined as ≥66% agreement. Results: The topics selected for the analysis were the differential efficacy of available bDMARDs on enthesitis/dactylitis, uveitis, radiographic progression and cardiovascular involvement, and the clinical response in non radiographic-axSpA and in patients receiving a second-line bDMARD. The Delphi rounds formulated 19 statements, all reaching the defined level of consensus in a second round including 25 rheumatologists highly skilled in the management of axSpA. Conclusion: Identified consensus statements can help clinicians to apply to routine-care settings the results from clinical studies and international recommendations, providing a guide for individualization of treatment strategy in axSpA patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Axial spondyloarthritis; biologic drugs; expert consensus; personalised therapy","adalimumab; biological product; certolizumab pegol; etanercept; golimumab; infliximab; secukinumab; ustekinumab; biological factor; biological therapy; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; consensus development; dactylitis; Delphi study; drug efficacy; enthesitis; human; Review; rheumatologist; spondylarthritis; uveitis; consensus; disease exacerbation; expert witness; Italy; patient selection; spondylarthritis; Biological Factors; Consensus; Disease Progression; Expert Testimony; Humans; Italy; Patient Selection; Spondylarthritis","Favalli, E.G.; Department of Rheumatology, Gaetano Pini Institute, Milan, Via Gaetano Pini, 9, Italy; email: enniofavalli@me.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",15689972,,ARUEB,"30339886","English","Autoimmun.

This paper offers an in-depth analytical review of the purchasing skills reported in the supply chain management (SCM) literature. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the most important skills and factors that influence these skills. Design/methodology/approach: This paper employs a systematic literature review methodology. Two databases, Scopus and Web of Science, are searched for relevant articles. The selected journal articles are used as sources to obtain a view not only on the relevant purchasing and supply management (P/SM) skills, but also on factors that emphasize certain P/SM skills. This paper also summarizes the ten skills ranked as most important (often described as the “top ten”) among the sample articles. Findings: The paper highlights the essential skills for purchasing professionals, verified both by their frequent appearances in rankings and by citation frequency in the literature. Generic managerial skills, such as communication, cost analysis, teamwork, problem-solving, negotiation, influencing, and persuasion, as well as information technology skills, received the most attention in the literature and rankings of the “top ten” P/SM skills. This paper provides a refined categorization of purchasing skills, which have merged recently with other discussed skills, such as political and entrepreneurial ones, into this categorization. This paper identifies factors that affect purchasing managers’ skills requirements. Originality/value: This paper presents a structured overview of 57 peer-reviewed articles from high-quality journals about purchasing skills. The review contributes to the purchasing skills literature by showing the most relevant skills and the factors that influence skills requirements. These factors also provide arenas for further research related to purchasing skills. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Literature review; Purchasing and supply management; Purchasing skills; Skills categorization",,"Karttunen, E.; School of Business and Management, Lappeenranta University of TechnologyFinland; email: elina.karttunen@lut.fi",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14635771,,BQMTF,,"English","Benchmarking",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058034724

MHealth has been projected as a possible solution to support women during pregnancy, birth and puerperium period, to increase the uptake of essential maternal services. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis study was aimed to determine the effectiveness of short message services (SMS)on Focused Antenatal Care (FANC) visits and the attendance of skilled birth professionals in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs). METHODS: We searched a broad body of literature from electronic databases-Cochrane review, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed and Google Scholar to collect comprehensive evidence on the role of SMS on FANC visits and skilled birth attendance. We extracted data from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) only. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effects models with inverse variance method in Review Manager (RevMan) computer software. Qualities of the included studies were determined by GRADEpro, and risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Of the 1224 non-duplicated articles screened, only 7 RCT studies representing 8324 participants met eligibility criteria and included in this synthesis. On aggregate, there were statistically significant associations in experimental group in that pregnant mothers who received text messaging had a 174% increase in FANC visits (OR = 2.74 (95% CI: 1.41, 5.32) and 82% in skilled birth attendance (OR = 1.82 (95% CI; 1.33, 2.49). The I2 test result indicated high heterogeneity I2 = 78% (P < .001). The overall qualities of included studies were moderate, and had low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: SMS has positive effects for the uptake of FANC visits and skilled birth attendance in LMICs. A short messaging service targeting pregnant woman is an invaluable, affordable intervention to improve maternal healthcare seeking behaviors.","FANC; LMICs; MHealth; Phone text messaging; Systematic review and meta-analysis","female; health care delivery; human; meta analysis; midwife; mobile phone; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; prenatal care; randomized controlled trial (topic); text messaging; Cell Phone; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Midwifery; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Text Messaging",,,"NLM (Medline)",17424755,,,"30466453","English","Reprod Health",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057079760

We investigated the overall survival (OS) advantage conferred by the addition of H to chemotherapy for HER2+ EBC patients and how the OS advantage changed over time. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRSs) published from January 1, 1990 to January 19, 2017, comparing systemic therapies used in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant settings to treat HER2+ EBC patients. Bayesian cumulative network meta-analyses (cNMAs) of OS were conducted to assess the published literature over time. Heterogeneity was assessed through sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Results: The SLR identified 31 unique studies (28 RCTs, 3 NRSs) included in the OS analyses from 2008 to 2016. In the reference case cNMA (RCTs alone), initial evidence demonstrated an OS advantage for H/chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone in HER2+ EBC patients. As additional OS data were published, the precision around this survival benefit strengthened over time. Both H/anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and H/non-anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens provided similar OS advantages for HER2+ EBC patients. Conclusion: This analysis represents the most comprehensive SLR/cNMA to date of published OS data in HER2+ EBC studies. These findings demonstrate why H/chemotherapy is now the established standard of care in HER2+ EBC. In the case of H, the benefits of early patient access far outweighed the risk of waiting for more precise information. © 2018 The Author(s).","Early breast cancer; HER2-positive breast cancer; Network meta-analysis; Survival; Systematic review; Trastuzumab","anthracycline; capecitabine; carboplatin; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epirubicin; fluorouracil; lapatinib; methotrexate; paclitaxel; taxane derivative; trastuzumab; vinorelbine tartrate; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; trastuzumab; follow up; genetic heterogeneity; hazard ratio; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; meta analysis; overall survival; practice guideline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; signal transduction; systematic review; breast tumor; female; metabolism; network meta-analysis; survival rate; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Receptor, ErbB-2; Survival Rate; Trastuzumab","Cameron, C.; Cornerstone Research Group Inc., 3228 South Service Road, Canada; email: ccameron@cornerstone-research.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",20464053,,,"30428932","English","Syst.

Design/methodology/approach: The systematic literature review (SLR) subject to analysis is based on empirical studies made between 1960 and 2016, and focuses on three dimensions of analysis: NIC, RIC and OIC. Four research questions were designed, using the following databases, namely, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar, for data collection purposes.

Therefore, ERP system is important strategy for organization's survival. One of the critical issues that affect a successful ERP implementation is the implementation method. In previous research, it showed that many organizations had faced complexity when they were implementing ERP in order to meet their requirements. In other cases, the ERP systems are unable to provide solution which is a simplicity of the necessary business processes. The ERP implementation complexity is one of the factors that lead the failures. Thus, here, we intend to propose an agile approach to reduce complexity and eventually our intention is to improve ERP implementing to become more successful. In this study, we are employing a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to identify the principles factors of the agile methods for ERP implementation. In result of employing this SLR method, we found that agile values and principles are correlated in ERP implementation complexity. © 2018 IEEE.","agile methods; complexity; ERP implementation; systematic literature review","Agile manufacturing systems; Information management; Agile approaches; Agile methods; Business environments; Business Process; complexity; ERP implementation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Enterprise resource planning",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

Goal: identify published studies that provide evidence of the influence of code smells on the occurrence of software bugs. Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to reach the stated goal. Results: The SLR selected studies from July 2007 to September 2017, which analyzed the source code of open source software projects and several code smells. Based on evidence of 16 studies covered in this SLR, we conclude that 24 code smells are more influential in the occurrence of bugs relative to the remaining smells analyzed. In contrast, three studies reported that at least 6 code smells are less influential in such occurrences. Evidence from the selected studies also point out tools, techniques, and procedures that should be applied to analyze the influence of the smells. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLR to target this goal. This study provides an up-to-date and structured understanding of the influence of code smells on the occurrence of software bugs based on findings systematically collected from a list of relevant references in the latest decade. © 2018 by the authors.","Bugs; Code fault-proneness; Code smells; Software evolution","Codes (symbols); Odors; Open source software; Program debugging; Bugs; Code smell; Fault proneness; Open source software projects; Programming styles; Software Evolution; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Open systems","Carneiro, G.F.; Programa de Pós-Graduação em Sistemas e Computação (PPGCOMP), Universidade Salvador (UNIFACS)Brazil; email: glauco.carneiro@unifacs.br",,"MDPI AG",20782489,,,,"English","Information",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056123625

The objective of this work is to conduct a new Systematic Literature Review (SLR) concerning competence-based recommender systems to analyse in relation to their nature and assessment of competences an others key factors that provide more flexible and exhaustive recommendations. To do so, a SLR research methodology was followed in which 25 competence-based recommender systems related to learning or instruction environments were classified according to multiple criteria. We evaluate the role of competences in these proposals and enumerate the emerging challenges. Also a critical analysis of current proposals is carried out to determine their strengths and weakness.

In 2014, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding this subject was published. The authors concluded that there were several gaps in the literature, such as the low level of accuracy of the techniques and little consensus on appropriate cost drivers. The goal of our work is to provide an updated review of the state of the art based on this reference SLR work. We applied a Forward Snowballing approach, in which our seed set included the former SLR and its selected papers. We identified a strong indication of solutions based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods for effort estimation in Agile Software Development (ASD). We also identified that there is a gap in terms of agreement on suitable cost drivers. Thus, we applied Thematic Analysis in the selected papers and identified a representative set of 10 cost drivers for effort estimation.

The twelve principles are inferred from agile values. Agile principles are composition of evolutionary requirement, simple design, continuous delivery, self-organizing team and face-to-face communication. Due to changing market demand, agile methodology faces problems such as scalability, more effort and cost required in setting up hardware and software infrastructure, availability of skilled resource and ability to build application from multiple locations. Twelve (12) principles may be practiced more appropriately with the support of cloud computing. This merger of agile and cloud computing may provide infrastructure optimization and automation benefits to agile practitioners. Objective: This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) identifies the techniques employed in cloud computing environment that are useful for agile development. In addition, SLR discusses the significance of cloud and its challenges. Method: By applying the SLR procedure, the authors select thirty-seven (37) studies out of six-hundred-forty-seven (647) from 2010 to 2017. Result: The result of SLR shows that the techniques using existing tools were reported in 35%, simulations in 20% and application developed in 15% of the studies. Evaluation of techniques was reported in 32% of the studies. The impact of cloud computing was measured by the classification of four major categories such as transparency 32%, collaboration 50%, development infrastructure 29% and cloud quality attributes in 39%. Furthermore, a large number of tools were reported in primary studies. The challenges posed by cloud adoption in agile was reported as interoperability 13%, security & privacy 18% and rest of the primary studies did not report any other research gaps. Conclusions: The study concludes that agile development in cloud computing environment is an important area in software engineering. There are many open challenges and gaps. In particular, more quality tools, evaluation research and empirical studies are required in this area. © 2018","Agile; Agile methodology; Agile software development; Cloud computing; Systematic review","Application programs; Cloud computing; Quality control; Agile; Agile Methodologies; Agile software development; Cloud computing environments; Development infrastructure; Face-to-face communications; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Software design","Younas, M.; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)Malaysia; email: younas.76@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049315459

One of the most useful tools in this regard is the integration of Human-to-Human Interaction gestures to facilitate communication and expressing ideas. Gesture recognition requires the integration of postures, gestures, face expressions and movements for communicating or conveying certain messages. The aim of this study is to aggregate and synthesize experiences and accumulated knowledge about Vision-Based Recognition (VBR) techniques. The major objective of conducting this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is to highlight the state-of-the-art in the context of vision-based gesture recognition with specific focus on hand gesture recognition (HGR) techniques and enabling technologies. After a careful systematic selection process, 100 studies relevant to the four research questions were selected. This process was followed by data collection, a detailed analysis, and a synthesis of the selected studies. The results reveal that among the VBR techniques, HGR is a predominant and highly focused area of research. Research focus is also found to be converging towards sign language recognition. Potential applications of HGR techniques include desktop applications, smart environments, entertainment, sign language interpretation, virtual reality and gamification. Although various experimental research efforts have been devoted to gestures recognition, there are still numerous open issues and research challenges in this field. Lastly, considering the results from this SLR, potential future research directions are suggested, including a much needed focus on grammatical interpretation, hybrid approaches, smartphone devices, normalization, and real-life systems. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Computer vision; Gesture recognition; Human-computer interaction; Systematic literature review; Vision-based gesture recognition","Computer vision; Human computer interaction; Virtual reality; Future research directions; Hand-gesture recognition; Human Computer Interaction (HCI); Human-to-human interactions; Sign Language recognition; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Vision-Based Gesture Recognition; Gesture recognition","Al-Shamayleh, A.S.; Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of MalayaMalaysia; email: ashamayleh@siswa.um.edu.my",,"Springer New York LLC",13807501,,MTAPF,,"English","Multimedia Tools Appl",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045935859

Since then, work in the scientific literature has stated that the application of software reuse offers benefits such as increase in quality and productivity. Nonetheless, in spite of many publications reporting software reuse experiences, evidence that such benefits having reached industrial settings is scarce. Objective: To identify and classify the benefits transferred to real-world settings by the application of software reuse strategies. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS). Our search strategies retrieved a set of 2,413 papers out of which 49 were selected as primary studies. We defined five facets to classify these studies: (a) the type of benefit, (b) the reuse process, (c) the industry's domain, (d) the type of reuse and (e) the type of research reported. Results: Quality increase (28 papers) and Productivity increase (25 papers) were the two most mentioned benefits. Component-Based Development (CBD) was the most reported reuse strategy (41%), followed by Software Product Lines (SPL, 30%). The selected papers mentioned fourteen industrial domains, of which four stand out: aerospace and defense, telecommunications, electronics and IT services. The application of systematic reuse was reported in 78% of the papers. Regarding the research type, 50% use evaluation research as the investigation method. Finally, 13 papers (27%) reported validity threats for the research method applied. Conclusions: The literature analyzed presents a lack of empirical data, making it difficult to evaluate the effective transfer of benefits to the industry. This work did not find any relationship between the reported benefits and the reuse strategy applied by the industry or the industry domain. Although the most reported research method was industrial case studies (25 works), half of these works (12) did not report threats to validity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Evidence-based software engineering; Industry; Real-world setting; Software reuse; Software reuse benefits; Software reuse processes; Systematic mapping study; Systematic review","Application programs; Industrial research; Industry; Mapping; Paper; Productivity; Component-Based Development; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Investigation methods; Productivity increase; Real world setting; Scientific literature; Systematic mapping studies; Systematic Review; Computer software reusability","Barros-Justo, J.L.; School of Informatics (E.S.E.I.), University of VigoSpain; email: jbarros@uvigo.es",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049539211

One critical inquiry remains in what manner can make and communicate the management of provided services for smart devices by an assortment of protest things that substituted and joined capably. Service composition process permits the interaction between user requirements and smart objects of IoT environment. Leveraging on the service discovery procedure can be influenced on finding the desired services. Consequently, choosing suitable services is the main challenge that covers functionality and required quality to combine several services as the integrated composite service in the IoT. The service composition process has been broadly considered with regards to web suppliers and business processes in the IoT. Currently, the IoT environment identifies the dynamic relationship topics on physical processes that are combined as the enhanced web services heterogeneously. This paper focuses on several service composition approaches that are applied in the IoT environment based on the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. The aim of this study is to analytically and statistically categorize and analyze the current research techniques on the service composition in the IoT (published between 2012 and 2017). A technical taxonomy is presented for the service composition approaches according to content of the existing studies that are selected with SLR method in this review with respect to functional and non-functional aspects in service composition approaches. The functional aspect emphasizes on verifying the behavior of service composition approach and the non-functional aspect considers the Quality of Service (QoS) in IoT environment. The approaches are compared with each other according to some technical aspects such as system correctness factors in functional properties approaches, and (QoS) factors, presented algorithms, and existing platforms in non-functional approaches. The advantages and disadvantages of each selected approach discussed as well as providing some hints for solving their weaknesses.

Surprisingly, especially in computer science, this activity is typically performed manually. Whilst in other disciplines fully automated analysis approaches exist, the lack of a reasonably complete, queryable and free-to-use literature catalog for computer science requires computer scientists to manually retrieve, merge and analyze literature from different catalogs. Although manual literature retrieval is enforced by the current main publishers, tool support to merge and cleanse literature found in different catalogs as well as to analyze the results is possible and needed. The systematic literature review toolkit, an Eclipse Rich Client Platform application leveraging the Eclipse Modeling Framework, aims to provide this support.

Method: This work presents a survey where experienced researchers that conducted SLRs between 2011 and 2015 answered questions about maintenance and traceability and, using software maintenance concepts, it addresses the SLRs maintenance process. From the 79 e-mails sent we reach 28 answers. Results: 19 of surveyed researchers have shown interest in keeping their SLRs up-to-date, but they have expressed concerns about the effort to be made to accomplish it. It was also observed that 20 participants would be willing to share their SLRs in common repositories, such as GitHub. Conclusions: There is a need to perform maintenance on SLRs.

But with the vast amount of research papers available today it has become more challenging to search and screen for appropriate papers to include in the review. This paper has analyzed different approaches to a literature review and explains the evolution from the traditional literature review to a more modern systematic literature review. The systematic literature review (SLR) can be classified into four key stages: Planning, Conducting, Analysis Synthesis, and Reporting. The purpose of this paper is to propose a modified SLR process that includes automation and bibliometrics. Automation is a method that can operationalize the manual tasks of the SLR by using specific tools and computer systems. Bibliometrics is a method to analyze the bibliographic data of published literature to provide an overview of the body of knowledge for a given field of inquiry. The proposed modified SLR process improves the previous versions that rely only on manual search and extraction, by combining the strength of both methods and integrating them into the stages of the SLR process.

Selecting and involving the appropriate stakeholders are considered one of the major factors for producing a successful system. Objective: The objectives of this paper is to provide precise investigation regarding the SQP domain with respect to its impact on prioritising requirements, identifying SQP attributes, critically investigating the existing techniques, and presenting the challenges and recommended future works. Method: The systematic literature review (SLR) guidelines proposed by Kitchenham are adopted to guide the review process. The identified related studies underwent a rigorous study selection process. Thus, 31 out of 210 identified studies were selected as primary studies to address adequately the formulated research questions. Results: Findings demonstrate that SQP is a crucial process in requirement prioritisation (RP) because of its ability to identify stakeholders’ impact on the systems requirements that lead to the production of a correctly prioritised list of requirements. Seventeen SQP attributes are revealed along with their description, usage impact, and degree of importance. Furthermore, nine techniques that focus on quantification and prioritisation of the stakeholders are identified and critically analysed in terms of their description, SQP process involved, SQP attributes used, types, and limitations. The findings reveal that these techniques face some challenges with respect to the lack of low-level implementation details, lack of automation and intelligence level, and heavy reliance on the involvement of experts. Conclusion: SQP has been extensively discussed in stakeholder analysis and requirement prioritisation domains. Based on the findings, a new intelligent solution is suggested to minimise the need for expert participation in conducting the SQP process along with proposing measurement criteria for the attributes used to evaluate the stakeholders. The deficiency of research works regarding the selection of SQP techniques is also observed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Stakeholders prioritisation; Stakeholders quantification; Systematic review","Information systems; Intelligent solutions; Stakeholder analysis; Stakeholders prioritisation; Stakeholders quantification; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Systems requirements; Software engineering","Hujainah, F.; Faculty of Computer System and Software Engineering, Universiti Malaysia PahangMalaysia; email: fadelhogina@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048274925

This is the reason why decision making process is increasingly complex requiring taking into account more and more different criteria. One of the important and commonly used techniques that support decision making processes is Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) while for the purpose of supporting a more realistic way of decision making, fuzzy logic is used. The paper examines the use of fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) in the urban mobility system. With the use of systematic literature review (SLR) it categorises peer reviewed journals’ articles related to the applications of FAHP in urban mobility system and extracted from Scopus and Web of science database, and analyses them methodologically. Papers were classified based on basic attributes of research papers, features of urban mobility system (UMS) where the FAHP was used, and use characteristics of the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). The results of this study indicated that the use of FAHP in urban mobility system is increasing with the first published paper in 2009. Our review has found that FAHP is used for very different purposes such as evaluation of customer expectations or citing a selection problem. Most often it is used in combination with other methods. Interestingly, there is only one paper that uses FAHP for decision making in the whole urban mobility system. © 2018, Strojarski Facultet.

On the other hand, it also has several challenges such as its impact on software quality. The implementation of software processes improvement, such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), can improve quality of software products. However, CMMI as a process improvement model has been rarely discussed in GSD context. To fill this gap a systematic literature study was conducted by using Kitchenham's method. It investigated GSD research from several databases between 2013-2018. At the end there are 12 selected papers. The findings indicate that CMMI is essential for the success of GSD projects. However, it requires multiple customizations and combinations with other standards. Concept Process Areas (PAs) and maturity level from CMMI are used in new standards Software Process Improvement (SPI) with different approaches. The results of this study are potential as a reference to develop customized CMMI to increase success rate in GSD projects. © 2018 IEEE.","Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI); Global Software Development (GSD); Process Area (PA); Software process improvement; Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","Computer software selection and evaluation; Integration; Process engineering; Capability maturity model integration; Global software development; Process areas; Software Process Improvement; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538669204,,,"English","Proc.

We followed recommendations from the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research-Society of Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force-2. The process involved scoping the decision problem by a working group and drafting a preliminary costeffectiveness model framework. A systematic literature review (SLR) of existing decisionanalytic models was performed and analysis of an RA registry was conducted to inform the structure of the draft conceptual model. Finally, an expert panel was convened to seek input on the draft conceptual model. The proposed conceptual model consists of three separate modules: 1) patient characteristic module, 2) treatment module, and 3) outcome module. Consistent with the scope, the conceptual model proposed six changes to current economic models in RA. These changes proposed are to: 1) use composite measures of disease activity to evaluate treatment response as well as disease progression (at least two measures should be considered, one as the base case and one as a sensitivity analysis); 2) conduct utility mapping based on disease activity measures; 3) incorporate subgroups based on guideline-recommended prognostic factors; 4) integrate realistic treatment patterns based on clinical practice/registry datasets; 5) assimilate outcomes that are not joint related (extra-Articular outcomes); and 6) assess mortality based on disease activity. We proposed a conceptual model that incorporates the current understanding of clinical and real-world evidence in RA, as well as of existing modeling assumptions. The proposed model framework was reviewed with experts and could serve as a foundation for developing future costeffectiveness models in RA. © 2018 Alemao et al.",,"biomedical technology assessment; cost benefit analysis; economic model; economics; expert witness; human; rheumatoid arthritis; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Expert Testimony; Humans; Models, Economic; Technology Assessment, Biomedical",,,"Public Library of Science",19326203,,POLNC,"30289926","English","PLoS ONE",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054443049

The purpose of this study was to estimate the costs of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with the new anti-PD1 immuno-oncology therapies, with the anti-CTLA-4 immuno-oncology therapy and with the combined therapy (CTLA4 + anti-PD1) in patients affected by metastatic melanoma. Materials and Methods: A probabilistic cost-of-illness (COI) model was developed to estimate the management costs of grade ≥ 3 adverse events associated with the new anti-PD1 therapies (pembrolizumab and nivolumab), the anti-CTLA-4 therapy (ipilimumab) and the combined therapy CTLA4 + anti-PD1 (nivolumab + ipilimumab) for the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma from the National Health Service (NHS) perspective in Italy. Identification of the epidemiological and cost parameters was carried out through a systematic literature review (SLR). Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty and variation in the model results. Results: The model estimated a cost associated with the management of grade ≥ 3 immune-related adverse events in patients with metastatic melanoma equal to €176.2 (95% CI 63.5–335.0) for anti-CTLA-4 therapy, €48.6 (95% CI 40.1–58.5) for the new anti-PDI therapies and €276.8 (95% CI 240.4–316.2) for the combined therapy. Among the innovative therapies for the considered metastatic melanoma, the combined therapy was the most expensive innovative treatment in terms of event management of immune-related grade ≥ 3 adverse events. Conclusion: This study may represent a useful tool to understand the economic burden associated with the management of irAEs associated with patients affected by metastatic melanoma. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; ipilimumab; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; CTLA4 protein, human; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; immunological antineoplastic agent; ipilimumab; monoclonal antibody; nivolumab; pembrolizumab; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cancer immunotherapy; colitis; cost of illness; diarrhea; experimental therapy; health care cost; human; hyperthyroidism; hypophysitis; hypothyroidism; immunopathology; Italy; metastatic melanoma; national health service; pneumonia; priority journal; rash; side effect; skin pruritus; vitiligo; adverse drug reaction; cost; economics; experimental therapy; melanoma; procedures; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological; Costs and Cost Analysis; CTLA-4 Antigen; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Ipilimumab; Italy; Melanoma; Nivolumab; Therapies, Investigational","Bini, C.; Economic Evaluation and HTA (CEIS-EEHTA), Faculty of Economics, University of Rome “Tor Vergata”, Via Columbia 2, Italy; email: chiara.stat@gmail.com",,"Springer International Publishing",11732563,,CDINF,"30143953","English","Clin.

Specific literature reviews, gathering and analysing the scientific production for Culture Heritage and GIS based research questions, are currently lacking. Therefore, the overall goal of this article is to provide an objective summary of the current state-of-the-art concerning how GIS has been used and what methods and analysis have been applied in the field of cultural heritage. In this sense, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the literature on the application of GIS in cultural heritage is carried out. To do so, the WOS and Scopus databases were considered. The results show that the dominant application of GIS is in the realisation of inventory and cataloguing of archaeological and architectural heritage. As a result of the quantitative analysis, we also verify the principal sources in which most studies have been published, highlighting the ""ISPRS Archives"" with 14 publications, the ""Lecture Notes in Computer Science"" with 9, and ""Proceedings of Digital Heritage"" with 6 publications. These data show that the sources that most publish mainly belong to the field of IT and Computer Science. In addition, the SLR shows that in the last three years there has been a greater tendency to use GIS to solve more specific problems of heritage through its use in conjunction with other tools such as BIM and photogrammetry. © Authors 2018.","Cultural heritage; Geographic information systems; GIS; State of the art; Systematic literature review","Architectural design; Information systems; Information use; Publishing; Architectural heritage; Cultural heritages; Literature reviews; Research questions; State of research; State of the art; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Geographic information systems","Ferreira-Lopes, P.; IUACC, HUM799, Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura, Universidad de SevillaSpain; email: pwanderley@us.es","Zlatanova S.Sithole G.Dragicevic S.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing",16821750,,,,"English","Int.

A systematic mapping study (SMS) performed in 2013 structured the research area on the use of FLOSS projects in SEE. Objective: Update the 2013 SMS with studies published in the last five years, classifying and summarizing them to discuss trends and identify research gaps in the context of the use of FLOSS projects in SEE. Method: We retrieved and analyzed a set of 4132 papers published from 2013 to 2017, from which 33 papers were selected and classified. We analyzed the new results and compared them with those from the previous SMS to confirm or discover trends. Results: The updated mapping summarizes the studies published in the last five years, most of them in conferences. Our analysis confirmed trends previously observed for three facets (SE area, curriculum choice and assessment type) and discovered new trends for other facets. Conclusion: Studies report the use of FLOSS projects in regular, comprehensive SE courses. The prevalence of experience reports over solution proposals in the last five years may indicate that researchers are more concerned with the use and evaluation of existing proposals, although there are still opportunities for more empirical work based on sound educational research methods. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","FLOSS development model; Free software; Open source software; Systematic literature reviews","Curricula; Engineering education; Engineering research; Mapping; Open systems; Development model; Educational research; Experience report; FLOSS projects; Free software; Industry needs; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Open source software",,"Gottardi T.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450365031,,,"English","ACM Int.

It is recognized that one search technique to update secondary studies is forward snowballing and that the number of studies identified is dependent on the electronic databases selected. However, there is no consensus on what electronic database is most appropriate for applying forward snowballing. Objective: The main goal of this study is to evaluate the use of different electronic databases for applying forward snowballing to update secondary studies. Method: Six updates were performed using forward snowballing with support from two electronic databases, one specific (IEEE Xplore) and the other generic (Google Scholar) and three combinations were evaluated to obtain new evidence during secondary studies updating: (1) searching using Google Scholar as electronic database; (2) searching using IEEE Xplore as electronic database; and (3) searching using both, IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar as complementary electronic databases. Results: The use of a specific electronic database is not indicated for forward snowballing application to update SLRs, since many relevant studies may not be identified. However, the use of a generic database is sufficient to discover the majority of the studies. Conclusions: The emergent contribution of our work to the body of knowledge in the SLR field is to add empirical evidence regarding the use of different electronic databases to support forward snowballing application during secondary studies updates. These results should help reviewers when they decide to find evidences to update their SLRs. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Forward snowballing; Search evidence; Secondary studies; Systematic literature review; Update","Software engineering; Forward snowballing; Search evidence; Secondary studies; Systematic literature review; Update; Database systems",,"Gottardi T.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450365031,,,"English","ACM Int.

Implemented in different areas of applications such as social and legal industries, finance, smart property, and supply chain networks. This technology assures immutability and integrity of data without the need of a third trusted party. Furthermore, BCT could guarantee a transparent and decentralized transaction system in businesses and industries. Even though general research has been done in the BCT, however, there is a lack of systematic analysis on current research challenges regarding how BCT is effectively applicable in supply chain management (SCM). A systematic literature review (SLR) of SCM based on blockchain does not exist yet. This work aims to explore and analyse the state-ofthe-Art on the BCT applications for SCM.

However, ongoing pain and disability is an issue for some patients, and recurrence contributing to reoperation is reported. It is important to identify prognostic factors predicting outcome to inform decision-making for surgery and rehabilitation following surgery. The objective was to determine whether pre-operative physical factors are associated with post-operative outcomes in adult patients [≥16 years old] undergoing lumbar discectomy or microdiscectomy. Methods: A systematic review was conducted according to a registered protocol [PROSPERO CRD42015024168]. Key electronic databases were searched [PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PEDro and ZETOC] using pre-defined terms [e.g. radicular pain] to 31/3/2017; with additional searching of journals, reference lists and unpublished literature. Prospective cohort studies with ≥1-year follow-up, evaluating candidate physical prognostic factors [e.g. leg pain intensity and straight leg raise test], in adult patients undergoing lumbar discectomy/microdiscectomy were included. Two reviewers independently searched information sources, evaluated studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias [QUIPS]. GRADE determined the overall quality of evidence. Results: 1189 title and abstracts and 45 full texts were assessed, to include 6 studies; 1 low and 5 high risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not possible [risk of bias, clinical heterogeneity]. A narrative synthesis was performed. There is low level evidence that higher severity of pre-operative leg pain predicts better Core Outcome Measures Index at 12 months and better post-operative leg pain at 2 and 7 years. There is very low level evidence that a lower pre-operative EQ-5D predicts better EQ-5D at 2 years. Low level evidence supports duration of leg pain pre-operatively not being associated with outcome, and very low-quality evidence supports other factors [pre-operative ODI, duration back pain, severity back pain, ipsilateral SLR and forward bend] not being associated with outcome [range of outcome measures used]. Conclusion: An adequately powered low risk of bias prospective observational study is required to further investigate candidate physical prognostic factors owing to existing low/very-low level of evidence. © 2018 The Author(s).","Back pain; Leg pain; Lumbar discectomy; Microdiscectomy; Narrative analysis; Prognosis; Prognostic factors; Radiculopathy; Systematic review","backache; Core Outcome Measure Index; discectomy; disease association; disease duration; disease severity; follow up; human; leg movement; leg pain; lumbar discectomy; lumbosacral spine; meta analysis; microdiscectomy; Oswestry Disability Index; pain intensity; postoperative period; prediction; preoperative evaluation; prognosis; quality of life; range of motion; Review; scoring system; systematic review; treatment outcome; walking distance; adolescent; adult; aged; convalescence; diagnostic imaging; disability; female; intervertebral disk; intervertebral disk degeneration; lumbar vertebra; male; middle aged; pain measurement; pathophysiology; postoperative pain; risk factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disability Evaluation; Diskectomy; Female; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Pain, Postoperative; Recovery of Function; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","Rushton, A.; Centre of Precision Rehabilitation for Spinal Pain CPR Spine, School of Sport, Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences, University of BirminghamUnited Kingdom; email: a.b.rushton@bham.ac.uk",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14712474,,,"30205812","English","BMC Musculoskelet.

Risk registries channel judgment of experts as a basis for risk analysis and should be tailored for each project to be more effective. Given their prevalence, there is a need for systematic integration of tacit and explicit knowledge to develop practical risk registries. Design/methodology/approach: A combined approach is proposed using the systematic literature review (SLR) technique to integrate explicit knowledge and Delphi technique to integrate tacit knowledge in the development of risk registries. This two-step approach further increases the robustness of the registries by validating them through integrating and contrasting multiple forms of knowledge for a tailored risk registry. Findings: The application of the proposed approach indicates that the use of multiple forms of knowledge can increase the robustness and practicality of risk registries. It also showcased its potential in the development of risk registries for complex projects. Examples include modification of risk factors obtained from the explicit sources of knowledge based on contextual tacit knowledge. Originality/value: The proposed approach is an imperative step to standardize the development of risk registries. With its inherent validation process through integrating and contrasting tacit and explicit knowledge, practitioners can use this approach to develop practical risk registries for different categories of projects. Integrating different forms of knowledge can increase the impact of registries beyond risk assessment and in contexts such as decision making and performance assessment. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Delphi technique; Knowledge management; Risk assessment; Risk identification; Risk registry; Systematic literature review",,"Khallaf, R.; Department of Structural Engineering and Construction Management, Future UniversityEgypt; email: rana.khallaf@fue.edu.eg",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",2044124X,,,,"English","Built Environ.

Methods: A systematic review was conducted of the literature published over the last two decades. Original research articles were included and reviewed if they concentrated on the topic of DES technique applied to health care management with model frameworks explicitly demonstrated. No restriction regarding the settings of DES application was applied. Results: A total of 211 papers met the predefined inclusion criteria. The number of publications included increased significantly especially after 2010.101 papers (48%) stated explicitly disease areas targeted, the most frequently modeled of which are related to circulatory system, nervous system and Neoplasm. The DES applications were distributed unevenly into 4 major classes: health and care systems operation (HCSO) (65%), disease progression modeling (DPM) (28%), screening modeling (SM) (5%) and health behavior modeling (HBM) (2%). More than 68% of HCSO by DES were focused on specific problems in individual units. However, more attempts at modeling highly integrated health service systems as well as some new trends were identified. Conclusions: DES technique has been an effective tool to approach a wide variety of health care issues. Among all DES applications in health care, health system operations research occupied the most considerable proportion and increased most significantly. Health Economic Evaluation (HEE) was the second most common topic for DES in health care, but with stable rather than increasing numbers of publications. © 2018 The Author(s).","Discrete event simulation; Health care management; Systematic review","community care; cost benefit analysis; decision making; health care delivery; human; organization and management; simulation training; system analysis; Community Health Services; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Operations Research; Simulation Training","Zhang, X.; Department of Health Care Management, Institute of Public Health and Nursing Research, Health Sciences, University of Bremen, Grazer Str. 2a, Germany; email: Xiange@uni-bremen.de",,"BioMed Central",14726963,,,"30180848","English","BMC Health Serv.

Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted according to Cochrane collaboration guidelines. The population of interest was adult patients with RA in remission or LDA. The reported outcomes of interest were any symptoms or burdens. Results: Fifty-one publications were identified through an eDatabase search. Together with 17 articles found through other sources, 68 were included for full text review. The most commonly reported residual symptoms were pain (number of studies = 25), fatigue (n = 21) and morning stiffness (n = 5). Reported disease burdens included mental health (n = 15), sleep disturbances (n = 7) and work productivity (n = 5), impairment in quality of life (n = 21), and functional disability (n = 34). Substantial residual symptoms and disease burdens were found to be present in patients in remission or LDA. Conclusion: This is the first SLR to investigate residual symptoms and disease burdens in RA patients in remission or LDA. The results indicate that despite achieving conventional clinical targets, the disease continues to affect patients, suggesting the existence of unmet need under the current treatment paradigm. © 2017, © 2017 Japan College of Rheumatology.

Despite this, UCC often fails in practice, which indicates a knowledge gap. Furthermore, research within the field can be described as fragmented, transdisciplinary and fast growing. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the field by describing dominant categories and themes within the area, identify gaps in order to propose a future research agenda, and provide insights into the needs of practitioners. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) targeting journal articles based on UCCs has been constructed with a supplementary snowball approach. A content analysis was performed to categorise themes in the research on UCCs and to identify research gaps, both within and outside the categories identified. Findings: Despite substantial research on UCC, very little research ends up in academic journals. In all, 56 articles address UCC. The most common topics were the role of stakeholders, design of distribution structures and transport resources, environmental and social consideration, and economic considerations. Much focus is directed towards finding “optimal” solutions and designs for potential initiatives with very little, if any, consideration to financial viability or the management of the UCC initiative. Research limitations/implications: This research points out existing gaps in the literature and proposes a future research agenda with UCCs as the focus. For example, although environmental and social arguments are often applied to justify the implementation of UCCs, few studies measure or evaluate their impact. Another important research gap is the economical consideration, both how to generate revenue and how to consider economies of scale. Practical implications: The practical contribution of most studies is directed towards municipalities. Few findings are presented in a way to support companies. Additionally, by bridging the gaps related to how stakeholders can collaborate and describe what is happening in a UCC, practitioners can use such information as guidelines. Originality/value: The results provide a research agenda for the fragmented research targeting UCCs, supporting the viability of future initiatives. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","City logistics; Content analysis; Structural literature review; Urban consolidation centre; Urban freight",,"Björklund, M.; Department of Management and Engineering, Linköping UniversitySweden; email: maria.bjorklund@liu.se",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09600035,,,,"English","Int.

The review was performed as part of a PhD study by the first author, which required the researcher to critically review all relevant studies in their specific research area. The review was conducted using a formal, scientific process and highlighted 20 relevant papers. Among the lessons learnt, undertaking an SLR was a time-consuming process. The search produced 1,987 papers, and screening the search yield was facilitated by using a pre-defined protocol. Extraction of data from each study was standardised and generated a 1-page summary of the key findings and methodology to facilitate comparisons of the included studies. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) tool was used for quality assessment. In the critical appraisal process, it is essential that reviewers have good baseline knowledge in the research subject, a solid understanding of the fundamentals of a robust research study including potential bias in research. With the great amount of information that a critical appraisal produces, good information management was key throughout the review to ensure the process was explicit and replicable and so that reviewers could justify their decisions. The methods and processes detailed in this report, as well as its lessons, are relevant to an SLR for any research subject. © 2018 Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions, Wash., DC.",,"human; information retrieval; knowledge; literature; methodology; procedures; qualitative research; standards; time factor; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Knowledge; Qualitative Research; Research Design; Review Literature as Topic; Time Factors","Bonfield, M.; University Hospitals Bristol, A225 Level 2 Queens Building, Bristol Royal InfirmaryUnited Kingdom; email: michelle.bonfield@uhbristol.nhs.uk",,"Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions",00907421,,,"30194822","English","J.

Text messaging, or short message service (SMS), is one reminder method that has been extensively researched. Most SMS-reminder research is distributed across a range of health care outcomes. The aim of this article is to systematically review the aggregate impact of these reminders on overall health care outcomes. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted and yielded 2316 articles. Studies were included if they used SMS reminders to support patient health care outcomes. Study methodology was aligned with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Results: Following screening, 162 articles met inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 93 investigated medical compliance reminders and 56 investigated appointment reminders. The review found that nearly all the SMS-reminder studies helped improve patient medical compliance and appointment reminders. Additionally, researchers reported numerous benefits from using SMS reminders, including ease of use, relative inexpensiveness, and rapid and automated message delivery. Minimal risks were reported and most participants found the reminders to be acceptable. Discussion: Text messages appear to be an effective reminder mechanism to promote improved patient appointment and medical compliance. Reminders should continue to be evaluated and improved to determine the most effective timing and frequency of messages for improving outcomes. © 2018 The Authors","Health care; mHealth; Reminders; SMS; Text message","adult; female; human; male; narrative; practice guideline; review; risk assessment; scientist; systematic review; transcription initiation","Schwebel, F.J.; University of Washington, Department of Psychology, 119A Guthrie Hall Box 351525, United States; email: fschwebe@uw.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",22147829,,,,"English","Internet Interv.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051012846

This systematic literature review aimed to identify exploratory methods on DP in pan-European studies and to inform the development of the DEterminants of DIet and Physical ACtivity (DEDIPAC) toolbox of methods suitable for use in future European studies. The search was conducted in three databases on prospective studies in healthy, free-living people across the whole life span. To identify validated DP methods, an additional search without regional restrictions was conducted. Studies including at least two European countries were retained. The search resulted in six pan-European studies applying principal component/factor analysis (PC/FA) (n 5) or cluster analysis (n 2). The criteria to retain PC/factors ranged from the application of the eigenvalue>1 criterion, the scree plot and/or the interpretability criterion. Furthermore, seven validation studies were identified: DP, derived by PC/FA (n 6) or reduced rank regression (RRR) (n 1) were compared using dietary information from FFQ (n 6) or dietary history (n 1) as study instrument and dietary records (n 6) or 24-h dietary recalls (n 1) as reference. The correlation coefficients for the derived DP ranged from modest to high. To conclude, PC/FA was predominantly applied using the eigenvalue criterion and scree plot to retain DP, but a better description of the applied criteria is highly recommended to enable a standardised application of the method. Research gaps were identified for the methods cluster analysis and RRR, as well as for validation studies on DP.","EPIC European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition; PCA principal component analysis; RRR reduced rank regression; SLR systematic literature review; DEterminants of DIet and Physical ACtivity knowledge hub; Dietary patterns; Exploratory dietary pattern methods; Pan-European studies; Systematic literature reviews; Validation","diet; Europe; feeding behavior; human; medical record; procedures; reproducibility; statistics; validation study; Diet; Diet Records; Diet Surveys; Europe; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Statistics as Topic; Validation Studies as Topic",,,"NLM (Medline)",14752662,,,"30064527","English","Br.

This systematic literature review (SLR) was intended to aid clinical decision-making by classifying historical studies to accurately characterize the response in second-line (progression on/after platinum-based therapy), and third-line (progression on/after platinum and cetuximab/other drug) settings. Methods: SLR was performed to characterize the ORR, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with therapies recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Clinical trials published in English between January 1, 1985, and September 30, 2016 were identified by searching the PubMed (Medline), Cochrane, and Embase databases. Results: The SLR identified 34 key studies in second-line R/M HNSCC patients, and one of these included a third-line patient cohort. However, several studies did not enrol a strictly second-line population. Response in a true second-line setting was elucidated by categorizing the studies using a novel framework defined according to the extent to which enrolled patients were second-line. Only seven studies were strictly second-line, with an estimated pooled ORR of 4% (95% CI = 2–8%; N = 414) for methotrexate and 11% (95% CI = 7–15%; N = 235) for cetuximab, and a reported ORR of 14% (N = 78) from a single study of paclitaxel. The median DOR was limited with cetuximab (∼4 months) and paclitaxel (∼7 months), and not reported for methotrexate. Median PFS or time to progression (TTP) ranged from 1.7 to 3.5 months, and median OS from 4.3 to 6.7 months. The ORR in the only third-line study was 0% (95% CI = 0–7; N = 53) for the platinum + cetuximab combination. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the historically bleak prognoses in patients with R/M HNSCC following PBT progression. Anti-PD-1 therapies, namely pembrolizumab and nivolumab, represent novel treatment options that may improve clinical outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; Nivolumab; Pembrolizumab; Platinum-based chemotherapy; Systematic literature review","antineoplastic agent; capecitabine; carboplatin; cetuximab; cisplatin; cisplatin derivative; docetaxel; fluorouracil; methotrexate; paclitaxel; vinorelbine tartrate; antineoplastic agent; cetuximab; monoclonal antibody; nivolumab; paclitaxel; PDCD1 protein, human; pembrolizumab; platinum complex; programmed death 1 receptor; tumor protein; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; clinical decision making; clinical outcome; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; meta analysis; metastasis; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; progression free survival; Review; systematic review; treatment duration; treatment response; clinical trial (topic); head and neck tumor; salvage therapy; squamous cell carcinoma; survival analysis; treatment outcome; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cetuximab; Clinical Trials as Topic; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Neoplasm Proteins; Nivolumab; Organoplatinum Compounds; Paclitaxel; Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor; Progression-Free Survival; Salvage Therapy; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome","Mayawala, K.; Quantitative Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, PPDM, 2000 Galloping Hill Rd, United States; email: kapil.mayawala@merck.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",13688375,,EJCCE,"30115469","English","Oral Oncol.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050812055

Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to identify phase 3/4 randomized controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of commonly used combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) including an NRTI backbone or that of commonly used NRTI-sparing regimens. A Bayesian random-effect model was used to compare virological suppression rates at 48 weeks for NRTI-sparing regimens and elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/TAF (E/C/F/TAF). Results: Twenty-three studies in treatment-naïve patients identified by the SLR were included in the NMA, including four studies assessing NRTI-sparing regimens. In treatment-naïve patients, the probability of achieving virological suppression at 48 weeks was between 40% and 60% higher with E/C/F/TAF than with NRTI-sparing strategies. The credible interval vs. darunavir/ritonavir (DVR/r) + raltegravir (RAL) and LPV/r monotherapy did not include 1. In the subgroup of naïve patients with viral load < 100 000 HIV-1 RNA copies/mL, a credible difference was found between NRTI-sparing treatments and E/C/F/TAF. Studies in treatment-experienced patients were too heterogeneous to allow for an NMA. Conclusions: The NMA results suggest that E/C/F/TAF represents a more effective option than NRTI-sparing regimens in terms of 48-week efficacy in treatment-naïve patients. Furthermore, TAF pharmacological properties, as well as tolerability results in clinical studies, suggest a safety profile similar to that of NRTI-sparing regimens. Thus, the E/C/F/TAF combination might represent a more appropriate option than NRTI-sparing regimens for initiation of antiretroviral therapy in treatment-naïve HIV-infected patients. © 2018 British HIV Association","antiretroviral therapy; drug toxicity; elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide combination; network meta-analysis; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-sparing regimen","abacavir plus lamivudine; cobicistat plus elvitegravir plus emtricitabine plus tenofovir alafenamide; darunavir plus ritonavir; fosamprenavir plus ritonavir; lopinavir plus ritonavir; raltegravir; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Bayes theorem; CD4 lymphocyte count; combination drug therapy; drug efficacy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus 1 infection; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; meta analysis; monotherapy; network meta-analysis; nonhuman; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); phase 4 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; virus load","Gallien, S.; Henri Mondor University HospitalFrance; email: sebastien.gallien@aphp.fr",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",14642662,,HMIEA,,"English","HIV Med.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050410659

However, a SLR study always faces validity threats because there exist subjective biases in certain steps of a SLR, such as identification of relevant studies and primary study selection. In software engineering field, many systematic review studies have adopted several methods to increase the reliability, for example, group decision and pilots search. In this paper, in order to reduce subjective biases, we propose a different solution to improve objectively the quality of SLR, which aims to apply text similarity analysis into two stages of a SLR. We propose that the synonym and hypernym relations of WordNet can be used to expand the search strings to improve the paper search process. In addition, through calculating the relevance of a paper and research issues according to text similarity analysis, the primary study selection can be improved. Then, through the experiment, we validate the effectiveness of our method. Our work provides a preliminary exploration of the combination of text similarity analysis and SLR in order to improve the quality of a SLR. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The study, in particular, empirically investigates the adoption of social media (SM) tools by firms operating in two conservative B2B service industries. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review is carried out driving to a deeper understanding of the current state of knowledge on SM in B2B services. Leading peer-review international journals are scrutinized performing ad-hoc queries on the Scopus database using pre-defined keywords. Moreover, a quantitative research is conducted on 60 firms, i.e. tanker shipping companies and ocean carriers, providing empirical insights on their SM activity on three SM platforms, i.e., Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. Findings: The outcomes from sample firms shed lights on the adoption rate of the most diffused SM tools, the size of the digital networks of stakeholders (number of followers), the intensity of the communication activity (number of posts, shares, photos, videos), and the level of customer engagement (number of likes and shares). Practical implications: Research findings suggest to managers that SMM might be an easy-accessible and low-cost option for keeping the pace of sectorial transformations and creating a competitive advantage even in conservative sectors. Originality/value: The paper, by investigating B2B service sectors, addresses an interesting gap in SMM literature as prior studies mostly focused on B2C industries and manufacturing contexts. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","B2B services; Social media marketing; Transport","Commerce; Competition; Marketing; Query languages; B2B services; Communication activities; Design/methodology/approach; International journals; Quantitative research; Social media marketings; Systematic literature review; Transport; Social networking (online)","Buratti, N.; Department of Economics and Business Studies, Universita degli Studi di GenovaItaly; email: buratti@economia.unige.it",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17542731,,,,"English","TQM J.",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045135935

To achieve this, the authors updated the research on lean supportive practices and inhibitors of lean technical practices presented by Hadid and Afshin Mansouri (2014) through a systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR focused on empirical studies/cases from the past 15 years and confirmed the inhibitors of lean technical practices. As a result, Toyota Kata is proposed as a KM solution to the inhibitors of lean service implementation in service companies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors carried out an SLR to identify inhibitors of lean service in real case applications and analyzed the resulting bibliographic portfolio using KM as a lens, along with three theories: universal theory, socio-technical systems theory and contingency theory, which assist in highlighting and clarifying the potential impact of using Toyota Kata as a solution to the inhibitors of lean technical practices. Findings: When the authors analyzed the inhibitors of lean technical practices, they discovered that there is a strong relationship between the inhibitors and the individual (staff) personal characteristics regarding commitment, involvement, communication and preparation. These inhibitors and characteristics should work as a system, and Toyota Kata improves people’s skills and process performance by connecting people, processes and technology. Also, the authors noted that the Toyota Kata concept used can provide benefits in the implementation of lean service for companies, such as the internalization of continuous improvement, this becoming part of the company culture. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that Toyota Kata provides an effective way to achieve KM. Research limitations/implications: This study may not have enabled a complete coverage of all existing peer-reviewed articles in the field of practices and inhibitors presented by Hadid and Afshin Mansouri (2014). However, it seems reasonable to assume that in this review, a large proportion of the studies available was included. Practical implications: This paper opens a new perspective on the use of Toyota Kata by managers as a solution to implement KM, spinning the spiral of knowledge. Originality/value: This is the first study that seeks empirical evidence of inhibitors of lean technical practices and proposes Toyota Kata as a KM Solution for these issues. As a result, this study advances the facility to overcome these inhibitors, opening a new perspective for management to lead in achieving operational excellence. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Inhibitors; Knowledge management; Lean service; Supportive practices; Toyota Kata","Computer applications; Corrosion inhibitors; Information science; Continuous improvements; Design/methodology/approach; Lean services; Personal characteristics; Sociotechnical systems theory; Supportive practices; Systematic literature review (SLR); Toyota Kata; Knowledge management","Ferenhof, H.A.; Post-Graduation Program in Information and Communication Technologies, Universidade Federal de Santa CatarinaBrazil; email: helio@igci.com.br",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20595891,,,,"English","VINE J.

Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, MEDLINE In-Process and CENTRAL databases were systematically searched to identify English-language publications of relevant studies of approved DMTs for RRMS. Searches were conducted from database inception to January 2017. Conference websites and trial registries were also searched. NMA considered the effects of DMTs on annualized relapse rate (ARR), confirmed disease progression (CDP), no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) and safety. Results: Of 10,825 articles retrieved and screened, 44 studies assessing 12 DMTs contributed to the NMA. In patients with active RRMS, cladribine tablets were associated with a significant 58% reduction in ARR versus placebo (p <.05); cladribine tablets were similar or significantly better than other DMT regimens and ranked fourth among DMTs, behind alemtuzumab, natalizumab and ocrelizumab. For CDP for 6 months and NEDA, improvements with cladribine tablets were significantly greater than those of placebo (p <.05), with no comparator DMT demonstrating significantly better results. Similar findings were reported in the HRA + DAT population. Overall adverse event risk for cladribine tablets did not differ significantly from that of placebo and most alternative DMTs. Conclusion: In this first NMA to consider cladribine tablets, ocrelizumab and daclizumab for treatment of RRMS, cladribine tablets are a comparatively effective and safe alternative to other DMTs in both active RRMS and HRA + DAT populations. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Cladribine tablets; disease modifying treatments; efficacy; high disease activity; network meta-analysis; relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis; safety","alemtuzumab; cladribine; daclizumab; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; fingolimod; natalizumab; ocrelizumab; teriflunomide; cladribine; Article; disease activity; disease duration; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; Embase; human; Medline; meta analysis; multiple sclerosis; recurrence risk; systematic review; tablet; comparative study; multiple sclerosis; network meta-analysis; tablet; Alemtuzumab; Cladribine; Humans; Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting; Natalizumab; Network Meta-Analysis; Tablets","Harty, G.; Merck Serono Ltdm, Bedfont Cross, Stanwell Rd, United Kingdom; email: gerard.harty@merckgroup.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",03007995,,CMROC,"29149804","English","Curr.

It can occur within a group of two or more students. Therefore, the learners' grouping is an essential task for establishing collaboration and cooperation among them to achieve a common goal. However, with the increasing number of students as well as their different settings (academic, cognitive, emotional, social, etc.), the students grouping task becomes harder and more complex to build a good collaborative learn-ing environment. Hence, several researchers proposed different approaches for obtaining approximate solutions to handle this diversity and take advantages from it. In this context, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to pinpoint the relevant research works that address the students grouping problem. We also we focus on the ACO bio-inspired approach to discuss its advantages and how students group formation can be initially constructed by ACO method. In accordance with this, we adapt and simulate an existing ACO algorithm with randomly generated data. The obtained results show an interesting starting point for further works in order to develop a new approach based on real educational data. © 2018 IEEE.","ant colony optimization (ACO); cell formation/group technology; clustering; Collaborative learning Teams (CLT); students' group formation problem (SGFP); systematic literature review (SLR)","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Cellular manufacturing; Teaching; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Cell formation; clustering; Collaborative learning; Group formations; Systematic literature review (SLR); Students",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538646236,,,"English","Int.

However, in recent years, due to the emergence of green software engineering, software developers are compelled to focus more on green and sustainable aspects of software. Green software engineering aims to design, develop, and use the software with confined energy and computing resources. Recently, software engineers in global software development have adapted agile methods for quick, interactive, and environment-friendly software development. In this study, we have identified 16 success factors, through systematic literature review (SLR) and applied contrived search criteria derived from the research questions; 80 relevant papers were identified and reviewed. Findings of the SLR study were then empirically validated through questionnaire survey in global software development industry, in which 106 experts from 25 different countries participated. The findings of our industrial survey are mostly in coherence with the SLR findings. However, there is a difference in ranks of the various success factors across the 2 data sets (SLR and industrial survey).

Objectives To assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in preventing or delaying RA onset with a systematic literature review (SLR) and meta-analysis (MA). Methods The SLR aimed to include all reports of randomised controlled trials of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs or glucocorticoids used in patients presenting genetic and/or environmental risk factors for RA and/or systemic autoimmunity associated with RA, and/or symptoms without clinical arthritis and/or unclassified arthritis and in patients with RA. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases for English articles published from 2006 to 2016 using the keywords undifferentiated arthritis' or very early rheumatoid arthritis' with 'therapy' or 'treatment'. Main outcome was RA occurrence, defined as fulfilment of the 1987 ACR criteria. The MA was performed with RevMan with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results Among 595 abstracts screened, 10 reports of trials were selected. The studies included 1156 patients, with mean symptom duration 16.2±12.6 weeks. The occurrence of RA was available for nine studies, assessing methylprednisolone, methotrexate, a tumour necrosis factor blocker, abatacept or rituximab. In the group arthralgia without arthritis (people at risk of RA), the MA of the two available studies did not show significant reduction in RA occurrence at week 52 or more (pooled OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.49). For people with undifferentiated arthritis, the MA of the seven available studies revealed significant risk reduction with OR 0.73(95% CI 0.56 to 0.97).

Reverse engineering tools often define their own metamodels according to the intended purposes and features. Although each metamodel has its own advantages, its limitations may be addressed by other metamodels. Existing works have evaluated and compared metamodels and tools, but none have considered all the possible characteristics and limitations to provide a comprehensive guideline for classifying, comparing, reusing, and extending program metamodels. To aid practitioners and researchers in classifying, comparing, reusing, and extending program metamodels and their corresponding reverse engineering tools according to the intended goals, we establish a conceptual framework with definitions of program metamodels and related concepts. We confirmed that any reverse engineering activity can be clearly described as a pattern based on the framework from the viewpoint of program metamodels. Then the framework is used to provide a comprehensive taxonomy, named Program Metamodel TAxonomy (ProMeTA), which incorporates newly identified characteristics into those stated in previous works, which were identified via a systematic literature review (SLR) on program metamodels, while keeping the orthogonality of the entire taxonomy. Additionally, we validate the taxonomy in terms of its orthogonality and usefulness through the classification of popular metamodels. © 2018, The Author(s).","Program comprehension and analysis; Program metamodels; Reverse engineering; Taxonomy","Computer programming; Reverse engineering; Conceptual frameworks; Engineering activities; Meta model; Pattern-based; Program comprehension; Reverse engineering tools; Support programs; Systematic literature review (SLR); Taxonomies","Washizaki, H.; eXmotion Co., LtdJapan; email: washizaki@waseda.jp",,"Springer New York LLC",13823256,,ESENF,,"English","Empir Software Eng",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043530370

Design/methodology/approach: This paper identifies and synthesises information from academic journals and examines research designs and methods, data analysis techniques, geographic locations, industry engagements, year of publication, publishers, university and author affiliations. A collection of online databases from 1991 to 2016 were explored, using the keywords “third-party”, “logistics” and “outsourcing” in their title and/or abstract, to deliver an inclusive listing of journal articles in this discipline area. Based on this approach, a total of 263 articles were found and data were derived from a succession of variables. Findings: There has been a significant increase and concentration by researchers over the past 25 years focussing on logistics outsourcing. A need to implement best practice has been universally identified, owing to increasing global supply chain complexity. This analysis shows that only seven literature reviews were published in the logistics outsourcing discipline. Additionally, this study revealed that 42 per cent of the work in this field was found to be survey based and this trend in research indicates the development of the structural equation modelling and multi-criterion decision-making methods.

Among the topics covered by privacy, we can highlight how to establish anonymous communications. During the latest years we have seen an important research in this field. In order to know what the state of the art in the research in anonymous communication systems (ACS) is, we have developed a systematic literature review (SLR). Namely, our SLR analyzes several issues: activity performed in the field, major research purposes, findings, what the most ACS study, the limitations of current research, how is leading the research in this field and the most highly-cited articles. Our SLR provides an analysis on 203 papers found in conferences and journals focused on anonymous communications systems between 2011 and 2016. Thus, our SLR provides an updated view on the status of the research in the field and the different future topics to be addressed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anonymity; Anonymous communication systems; Anonymous communications; Privacy; Systematic literature review","Computer science; Data privacy; Electrical engineering; Anonymity; Anonymous communication; Anonymous communication systems; Research purpose; Research topics; State of the art; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Network security","Ruiz-Martínez, A.; Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Faculty of Computer Science, Campus of EspinardoSpain; email: arm@um.es",,"Elsevier Ltd",00457906,,CPEEB,,"English","Comput Electr Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035757325

The reliability of SLR as a method is not a given and largely depends on the rigor of the attempt to identify, appraise and aggregate evidence. Previous research, by comparing SLRs on the same topic, has identified search as one of the reasons for discrepancies in the included primary studies. This affects the reliability of an SLR, as the papers identified and included in it are likely to influence its conclusions. Objective: We aim to propose a comprehensive evaluation checklist to assess the reliability of an automated-search strategy used in an SLR. Method: Using a literature review, we identified guidelines for designing and reporting automated-search as a primary search strategy. Using the aggregated design, reporting and evaluation guidelines, we formulated a comprehensive evaluation checklist. The value of this checklist was demonstrated by assessing the reliability of search in 27 recent SLRs. Results: Using the proposed evaluation checklist, several additional issues (not captured by the current evaluation checklist) related to the reliability of search in recent SLRs were identified. These issues severely limit the coverage of literature by the search and also the possibility to replicate it. Conclusion: Instead of solely relying on expensive replications to assess the reliability of SLRs, this work provides means to objectively assess the likely reliability of a search-strategy used in an SLR. It highlights the often-assumed aspect of repeatability of search when using automated-search. Furthermore, by explicitly considering repeatability and consistency as sub-characteristics of a reliable search, it provides a more comprehensive evaluation checklist than the ones currently used in EBSE. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Credibility; Guidelines; Reliability; Search strategies; Secondary studies; Systematic literature reviews","Automation; Software engineering; Credibility; Guidelines; Search strategies; Secondary studies; Systematic literature review; Reliability","Ali, N.B.; Blekinge Institute of TechnologySweden; email: nauman.ali@bth.se",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042009714

SM requires skills beyond those of conventional microsurgery. Current microsurgery courses do not prepare a junior surgeon for such a challenge. Several models have been developed to assist in the early learning curve, but their true purpose, benefit, and validation have not been addressed. This systematic literature review summarizes the existing SM simulation models, and their likely impact on microsurgery training for small-caliber vessel-based procedures is assessed. Methods: An electronic literature search was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. From the literature search, 90 potential articles from MEDLINE and 300 articles from other databases were identified and screened. Twenty-five studies were screened against the inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers for a final critical analysis. Results: Thirty-six articles were included in the reviewing process, and 15 SM simulation training models were identified. The simulation models were classified as nonbiological or biological and as ex vivo or in vivo. None of these models demonstrated validity. However, critical analysis of the full-text articles established the clinical correlation of each model along with the specific skill demonstrated. A novel ladder-based curriculum was established. Further, an expert's questionnaire generated a Likert scale and the clinical impact of each SM simulation training model. Conclusion: This is the first review to highlight the clinical relevance of SM models and the need for validation. Currently, a variety of training models in SM appear to enable the acquisition of specific skills, and the clinical impact of a selection is recognized in a proposed SM simulation training curriculum. © 2018","Lymphaticovenous; Microsurgery curriculum; Simulation model; Supermicrosurgery; Training","bibliographic database; clinical practice; curriculum; data base; evidence based medicine; evidence based practice; human; in vivo study; learning curve; Likert scale; microsurgery; outcome assessment; predictive validity; priority journal; Review; screening test; simulation training; supermicrosurgery; surgical technique; surgical training; animal; clinical competence; education; microsurgery; reproducibility; Animals; Clinical Competence; Curriculum; Humans; Microsurgery; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training","Pafitanis, G.; Group for Academic Plastic Surgery, The Royal London Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, The Blizard Institute, Queen Mary University of London, 4 Newark Street, Whitechapel E1 2AT, United Kingdom; email: g.pafitanis@qmul.ac.uk",,"Churchill Livingstone",17486815,,,"29773411","English","J.

Replications test the credibility of original studies and can separate true results from those that are unreliable. Objective: In this paper we investigate the replication of defect prediction studies and identify the characteristics of replicated studies. We further assess how defect prediction replications are performed and the consistency of replication findings. Method: Our analysis is based on tracking the replication of 208 defect prediction studies identified by a highly cited Systematic Literature Review (SLR) [1]. We identify how often each of these 208 studies has been replicated and determine the type of replication carried out. We identify quality, citation counts, publication venue, impact factor, and data availability from all 208 SLR defect prediction papers to see if any of these factors are associated with the frequency with which they are replicated. Results: Only 13 (6%) of the 208 studies are replicated. Replication seems related to original papers appearing in the Transactions of Software Engineering (TSE) journal. The number of citations an original paper had was also an indicator of replications. In addition, studies conducted using closed source data seems to have more replications than those based on open source data. Where a paper has been replicated, 11 (38%) out of 29 studies revealed different results to the original study. Conclusion: Very few defect prediction studies are replicated. The lack of replication means that it remains unclear how reliable defect prediction is. We provide practical steps for improving the state of replication. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Replication; Reproducibility; Software defect prediction","Forecasting; Open source software; Software engineering; Data availability; Defect prediction; Open source datum; Replication; Reproducibilities; Scientific discipline; Software defect prediction; Systematic literature review (SLR); Defects","Mahmood, Z.; University of HertfordshireUnited Kingdom; email: z.mahmood4@herts.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043273528

Since 2010, there has been increased activity in the development of treatments that aim to delay progression of the disease. Objective: Our study involves a comprehensive review of the literature for evidence on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), healthcare resource use (HCRU) and costs, and an assessment of the burden of illness of the condition. Methods: We carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify economic evaluations and HRQoL studies. We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In Process for relevant studies from database origins to April 2017. Alongside the presentation of the study characteristics and the available evidence, we carried out a qualitative comparison using reference population estimates for HRQoL and national health expenditure for costs. Results: Our search identified a total of 3241 records. After removing duplicates and not relevant articles, we analysed 124 publications referring to 88 studies published between 2000 and 2017. Sixty studies were HRQoL and 28 were studies on costs or HCRU. We observed an exponential growth of publications in the last 3–5 years, with the majority of the studies conducted in Europe and North America. Among the HRQoL studies, and despite regional differences, there was some agreement between estimates on the absolute and relative level of HRQoL for patients with IPF compared with the general population. Regarding costs, after adjustments for the cost years and currency, the suggested annual per capita cost of patients with IPF in North America was estimated around US$20,000, 2.5–3.5 times higher than the national healthcare expenditure. Additionally, studies that analysed patients with IPF alongside a matched control cohort suggested a significant increase in resource use and cost. Conclusion: The reviewed evidence indicates that IPF has considerable impact on HRQoL, relative to the general population levels. Furthermore, in studies of cost and resource use, most estimates of the burden were consistent in suggesting an excess cost for patients with IPF compared with a control cohort or the national health expenditure. This confirms IPF as a growing threat for public health worldwide, with considerable impact to the patients and healthcare providers. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"acetylcysteine; azathioprine; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; pirfenidone; age; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; disease burden; economic evaluation; economic model; fibrosing alveolitis; health care utilization; hospital admission; human; lowest income group; oxygen therapy; priority journal; quality of life; Review; Short Form 36; St. George Respiratory Questionnaire; cost of illness; economics; fibrosing alveolitis; health care cost; health care planning; Cost of Illness; Health Care Costs; Health Resources; Humans; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis; Quality of Life","Diamantopoulos, A.; Symmetron LimitedUnited Kingdom; email: alexd@symmetron.net",,"Springer International Publishing",11707690,,PARME,"29492843","English","Pharmacoeconomics",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042602855

While there has been a proliferation of academic publications on natural hazards, risks and disasters on Indonesia, there has not yet been a systematic literature review (SLR) to determine the progress, key topics and authorships. SLR is important so researchers can build upon existing works, avoid bias, determine major research topics and the need for further research, and strengthen research capacity in the future. The author conducts a SLR of publications indexed within the Scopus database from 1900 to 2016 on topics related to disasters and climate change in Indonesia. Two major findings are outlined. The first is related to major research topics: (1) natural hazard, risk and disaster assessments (HRD); (2) disaster risk reduction (DRR); and (3) climate change risks, vulnerability, impacts and adaptation (CC). More than half are related to HRD and focus on volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and earthquakes. Publications on DRR are related to governance, early-warning systems, and recovery and reconstruction. Those on CC discuss carbon emission, forestry, governance and sectoral impacts. The author calls for future research on different hazards, different locations, and impacts of disasters and climate change. Risks and vulnerability assessments from hydro-meteorological and geophysical hazards are needed. Other locations beyond Sumatra and Java islands are to be examined. Urban risk assessments and the economic and social impacts of disasters and climate change on vulnerable places and communities are equally important. Risk governance at the national, local and community level is to be strengthened to increase resilience. The second finding examines the roles of Indonesian researchers and organizations. Findings show limited progress in research, publication and collaboration. International/non-Indonesian authors dominate the literature, and only half of the publications are co-authored by Indonesians. International collaborations have been conducted by very few Indonesian organizations. This could be due to limited experience in academic collaboration, power play amongst researchers, lack of research capacity, weak English academic writings skills and limited provisions within higher-education systems. The author recommends more funding and incentives for collaborations; training on English academic writing and journal article publications; capacity building especially for early careers, female and social science researchers; encouragement of multi-disciplinary collaborations; and strengthening of science communication in social media and science-policy advocacy. © Author(s) 2018.",,"climate change; disaster management; literature review; natural hazard; risk assessment; socioeconomic impact; trend analysis; Indonesia; Scopus","Djalante, R.; United Nations University, Institute for the Advanced Study of SustainabilityJapan; email: riyanti.djalante@gmail.com",,"Copernicus GmbH",15618633,,,,"English","Nat.

It is important for librarians to know which methods of teaching engineering information literacy (EIL) are most effective for student learning, in order to make efficient and effective use of student and librarian time. Purpose/Hypothesis - The authors reviewed the existing literature to find indications of the most effective methods for teaching and/or integrating EIL, both in face-to-face and online instruction. Design/Method - The authors have completed the first stages of a systematic literature review (SLR), through the creation of the final dataset. The initial searches generated a set of 1224 papers prior to duplicate removal. Duplicate removal and multiple rounds of review, using authors-created inclusion and exclusion criteria, narrowed the final dataset to 13 papers. Scope/Method - The lessons learned in the process around searching, tools for data evaluation, and articulation of criteria are presented. As a result of this portion of the SLR process, the authors identified characteristics of the undergraduate-focused EIL literature that are shared. Results/Discussion - A brief summary of the process to arrive at a final dataset of 13 papers, the challenges in the process, and the refinements made at each step are outlined. Conclusion - There are several preliminary conclusions to be drawn, many of which will not be surprising to the engineering librarian community. The dataset came down to just 13 items because much of the EIL literature is based on student self-report data on how the class went, or was it enjoyable, rather than on actual student learning gains. As such, these papers did not meet the criteria for demonstrated learning gains as a measure of effectiveness. In addition, some papers were excluded for lack of clarity about methods. In these studies it is not evident how either the intervention and/or the assessment was conducted, with regard to timing, instrument used, etc. Some additional papers were excluded because a control or comparison group was not included to establish ""effectiveness"" of the intervention. Overall, the authors note the EIL literature frequently reports descriptive statistics, showing that data has been gathered, but sometimes falls short of a full analysis that allows the researchers to draw meaningful/well-grounded conclusions from the data. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",,,,,"American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,,"English","ASEE Annu.

In order to maximize the success of software projects, agile methods focus on people and their interactions. However, agile projects still suffer from the risks of failure. Understanding that PM is a complex and central activity in the SDP, this paper aims to map how academic studies describe the PM in the software development environment, what good practices are described by these studies and how the software industry has applied the PM. Therefore it is intended to build a PM model for agile software development approaches. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out in order to obtain data regarding the state of the art of PM in the agile development, and also a questionnaire format survey, which was answered by professionals working in the industry to map the application of PM mechanisms in software development organizations. From the data obtained in the SLR and in the questionnaires applied it was proposed a model of People Management. The proposed model was generically constructed to serve as a PM guide in agile projects, regardless organization characteristics and the development team where the model will be implemented. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Agile Methodologies; People management; People Management Model; Software Development Process","Agile manufacturing systems; Application programs; Information systems; Information use; Project management; Surveys; Agile Methodologies; Agile software development; People management; Software development environment; Software development organizations; Software development process; Software project management; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450365598,,,"Portuguese","ACM Int.

To this end, many guidelines have been proposed to contribute to the execution and repeatability of literature reviews, and to the confidence of their results, especially regarding systematic literature reviews (SLR). To investigate similarities and differences, and to characterize the challenges and pitfalls of the planning and generated results of SLR research protocols dealing with the same research question and performed by similar teams of novice researchers in the context of the software engineering field. We qualitatively compared (using Jaccard and Kappa coefficients) and evaluated (using DARE) same goal SLR research protocols and outcomes undertaken by similar research teams. Seven similar SLR protocols regarding quality attributes for use cases executed in 2010 and 2012 enabled us to observe unexpected differences in their planning and execution. Even when the participants reached some agreement in the planning, the outcomes were different. The research protocols and reports allowed us to observe six challenges contributing to the divergences in the results: researchers’ inexperience in the topic, researchers’ inexperience in the method, lack of clearness and completeness of the papers, lack of a common terminology regarding the problem domain, lack of research verification procedures, and lack of commitment to the SLR. According to our findings, it is not possible to rely on results of SLRs performed by novices. Also, similarities at a starting or intermediate step during different SLR executions may not directly translate to the next steps, since non-explicit information might entail differences in the outcomes, hampering the repeatability and confidence of the SLR process and results. Although we do have expectations that the presence and follow-up of a senior researcher can contribute to increasing SLRs’ repeatability, this conclusion can only be drawn upon the existence of additional studies on this topic. Yet, systematic planning, transparency of decisions and verification procedures are key factors to guarantee the reliability of SLRs. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Evidence-based software engineering; Exploratory study; Novice researchers; Systematic literature review","Computer software; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Explicit information; Exploratory studies; Novice researchers; Planning and execution; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technical literature; Software engineering","Ribeiro, T.V.; Systems Engineering and Computer Science Program (PESC/COPPE), Federal University of Rio de JaneiroBrazil; email: tvribeiro@cos.ufrj.br",,"Springer New York LLC",13823256,,ESENF,,"English","Empir Software Eng",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032506315

Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of SCLC on healthcare costs through a systematic literature review (SLR). Methods: Using the OVID search engine, the SLR was conducted in PubMed, MEDLINE In–Process, EMBASE, EconLIT and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED). Searches were limited to studies published between January 2005 and 24 February 2016, and excluded preclinical studies. Additional internet-based searches were conducted. In total, 229 abstracts were retrieved and systematically screened for eligibility, with 17 publications retained. Results: The majority of publications provided data on limited and extensive disease of SCLC. The reported burden was categorised as direct costs and indirect costs, with the majority of the publications (n = 16) reporting on direct costs and one reporting on both direct and indirect costs. The only indirect costs reported for SCLC were lost productivity (premature mortality costs) and caregiver burden. Chemotherapy, diagnostic costs and treatment costs were identified as significant costs when managing SCLC patients, including the associated treatment costs such as hospitalisation, nurse visits, emergency room visits, follow-up appointments and outpatient care. Conclusions: SCLC and its treatment have a substantial impact on costs. The scarcity and heterogeneity of economic cost data negated meaningful cost comparison, highlighting the need for further research. Capturing the economic burden of SCLC may help patients and clinicians make informed treatment choices and improve SCLC management. © 2017, The Author(s).",,"antibiotic agent; antineoplastic agent; carboplatin; cisplatin; etoposide; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; hemopoietic growth factor; irinotecan; pegfilgrastim; topotecan; bone metastasis; cancer chemotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; caregiver burden; emergency care; febrile neutropenia; follow up; health care cost; hospitalization cost; human; non small cell lung cancer; outpatient care; priority journal; productivity; Review; skull irradiation; small cell lung cancer; symptom; systematic review","Enstone, A.; Adelphi Values, Adelphi MillUnited Kingdom; email: ashley.enstone@adelphivalues.com",,"Springer",25094262,,,,"English","PharmacoEcon.

As head-to-head trials assessing once-weekly semaglutide as an add-on to 1–2 oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) vs other GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are limited, a network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed. The objective was to assess the relative efficacy and safety of once-weekly semaglutide vs GLP-1 RAs in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on 1–2 OADs. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted in order to identify trials of GLP-1 RAs in patients inadequately controlled on 1–2 OADs. Data at 24 ± 4 weeks were extracted for efficacy and safety outcomes (feasible for analysis in a NMA), which included the key outcomes of change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and weight, as well as discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs). Data were synthesized using a NMA and a Bayesian framework. Results: In total, 26 studies were included across the base case analyses. Once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg was associated with significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and weight vs all GLP-1 RA comparators. Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg also achieved significantly greater reductions in HbA1c and weight compared with the majority of other GLP-1 RAs. Both doses of once-weekly semaglutide were associated with similar odds of discontinuation due to AEs compared with other GLP-1 RAs. Conclusion: Overall, once-weekly semaglutide 1.0 mg as an add-on to 1–2 OADs is the most efficacious GLP-1 RA in terms of the reduction of HbA1c and weight from baseline after 6 months of treatment. In addition, the analysis suggests that once-weekly semaglutide is well tolerated and not associated with an increase in discontinuations due to AEs compared with other GLP-1 RAs.

To achieve this, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SRL) by retrieving studies with snowballing technique, selecting studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extracting and analyzing data to answer our research questions. As the outcome, we retrieved 786 studies and selected 16 primary studies published between 2005 and 2017. The results reveal that the class diagram has been customized through the profile-based mechanism to provide proper support to analysis and design of context-awareness and self-adaptiveness properties. © 2018 ACM.","domain-specific modeling language (DSML); self-adaptive systems (SaS); snowballing technique; systematic literature review (SLR); unified modeling language (UML)","Adaptive systems; Embedded systems; High level languages; Software engineering; Specification languages; Uncertainty analysis; Context- awareness; Domain specific modeling languages; Inclusion and exclusions; Research questions; Self-adaptive system; snowballing technique; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Unified Modeling Language",,,"IEEE Computer Society",02705257,9781450357159,PCSED,,"English","Proc Int Conf Software Eng",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051531753

Integrating software security at each phase of SDLC has become an urgent need. To address software security, various approaches, techniques, methods, practices, and models have been proposed and developed. However, recent research shows that many software development methodologies do not explicitly include methods for incorporating software security during the development of software as it evolves from requirements engineering to its final disposal. The primary objective of this research is to study the state-of-the-art of security in the context of SDLC by following systematic mapping study (SMS). In the second phase, we will identify, through systematic literature review (SLR) and empirical study in the industry, the software security contributions, security challenges and their practices for global software development (GSD) vendors. The ultimate aim is to develop a Software Security Assurance Model (SSAM) to assist GSD vendor organisations in measuring their readiness towards the development of secure software. © 2018 ACM.","Case study; Empirical Study; Global Software Development; Software Development Life Cycle; Software Security; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping study; Vendors",,,,"IEEE Computer Society",02705257,9781450357173,PCSED,,"English","Proc Int Conf Software Eng",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051552000

It is characterized by acute clinical symptoms such as painful vaso-occlusive crises, which can impair health-related quality of life (HRQL). This study was conducted to identify validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments for use in future trials of potential treatments for SCD. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify United States (US)-based studies published in English between 1997 and 2017 that reported on validated PRO instruments used in randomized controlled trials and real-world settings. The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used to assess the quality of PRO instruments. Results: The SLR included 21 studies assessing the psychometric properties of 24 PRO instruments. Fifteen of those instruments were developed and validated for adults and 10 for children (one instrument was used in both children and young adults aged up to 21 years). Only five of the 15 adult instruments and three of the 10 pediatric instruments were developed specifically for SCD. For most instruments, there were few or no data on validation conducted in SCD development cohorts. Of the 24 PRO instruments identified, 16 had strong internal reliability (Cronbach's α ≥0.80). There was often insufficient information to assess the content validity, construct validity, responsiveness, or test-retest reliability of the instruments identified for both child and adult populations. No validated PRO instruments measuring caregiver burden in SCD were identified. Conclusions: The evidence on the psychometric properties of PRO instruments was limited. However, the results of this SLR provide key information on such tools to help inform the design of future clinical trials for patients with SCD in the US. © 2018 The Author(s).","COSMIN; Patient-reported outcomes; Psychometric properties; Sickle cell disease","Article; caregiver burden; construct validity; content validity; human; patient-reported outcome; psychometry; quality of life; reliability; sickle cell anemia; systematic review; test retest reliability; United States; adult; child; male; pathophysiology; preschool child; psychology; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); reproducibility; sickle cell anemia; validation study; young adult; Adult; Anemia, Sickle Cell; Child; Child, Preschool; Humans; Male; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Reproducibility of Results; Validation Studies as Topic; Young Adult","Sarri, G.; Evidera, Metro Building, 6th Floor, 1 Butterwick, United Kingdom; email: grammati.sarri@evidera.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14777525,,,"29784054","English","Health Qual.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacological treatments are the best described treatments in the literature. Aim: To test whether there is evidence on treatment based on CBT, medication or a combination of these. Methods: Systematic and critical review of the literature on CBT and/or pharmacological treatments of SM. Literature was sought on PubMed, Embase and Psycinfo in March 2017. Results: Of the included studies, six examined CBT, seven pharmacologic treatment and two a combination of these. Using CBT 53/60 children improved symptomatically whilst respectively 55/67 and 6/7 improved using pharmacologic- and combination-treatment. Conclusion: Pharmacologic treatment and especially CBT showed promising results supported by some degree of evidence, which combination treatment lacks. Yet small numbers, few RCTs, heterogeneous study designs, lack of consistent measures, short treatment and follow-up periods, generally limits the evidence.

Today, cloud computing is actually one of the main improvements in the computing procedure. However, by raising user interactions, the complexity of cloud processes is increasing with the advancement of technology. To evaluate the cloud computing challenges, the simulation experiments just satisfy the non-functional properties with a limited majority in forms of QoS factors. In addition, using simulation approaches have not been sufficient for developed complex cloud services that omit some critical test cases in the state space of the model. On the other hand, formal verification is an essential section in the complex information systems development that satisfies both functional and non-functional properties. Therefore, it is essential that the cloud systems use formal verification approaches for increasing the correctness of the system quality in all of the state space of the model. Despite the importance of the formal verification approaches in the cloud environments, to the best of our knowledge, there is not any systematic, comprehensive and detailed survey and review in the field of formal verification approaches and standards in the cloud computing. This paper provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to examine the current technical studies (published between 2011 and July 2017) in formal verification of the cloud computing. Also, this paper categorizes the formal verification approaches in three classic fields: specification and process algebra, model checking, and theorem proving. The verification approaches are compared with each other according to some technical properties such as specification methods, modeling approaches, verification tools and verification methods. The advantages and disadvantages of each selected study as well as some hints are discussed for solving their problems. The brief contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) providing a comprehensive literature review of the formal verification approaches in the cloud computing, (2) designing a technical taxonomy for the verification approaches in various modeling and specification methods, (3) presenting a technical analysis and comparison for the main challenges of the formal verification in the cloud and (4) highlighting the future open issues in the recent topics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cloud computing; Formal verification; Specification; Systematic literature review","Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Model checking; Network function virtualization; Specifications; Complex information systems; Internet based computing; Non functional properties; Simulation approach; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technical properties; Verification method; Formal verification","Rahmani, A.M.; Department of Computer Engineering, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad UniversityIran; email: rahmani@srbiau.ac.ir",,"Elsevier B.V.",09205489,,CSTIE,,"English","Comput Stand Interfaces",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037726513

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to determine the characteristics of an FLS that lead to improved patient outcomes. We conducted a SLR, including articles published between 2000 and February 2017, using global (Medline, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane Library) and local databases. Studies including patients aged ≥ 50 years with osteoporotic fractures enrolled in an FLS were assessed. Information extracted from each article included key person coordinating the FLS (physician, nurse or other healthcare professional), setting (hospital vs community), intensity (single vs multiple), duration (long vs short term), fracture type and gender. A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials was conducted based on the key person coordinating the FLS. Out of 7236 articles, 57 were considered to be high quality and identified for further analysis. The SLR identified several components which contributed to FLS success, including multidisciplinary involvement, driven by a dedicated case manager, regular assessment and follow-up, multifaceted interventions and patient education. Meta-analytic data confirm the effectiveness of an FLS following an osteoporotic fracture: approximate 27% increase in the likelihood of BMD testing and up to 21% increase in the likelihood of treatment initiation compared with usual care. The balance of evidence indicates that the multifaceted FLS and dedicated coordination are important success factors that contribute to effective FLS interventions which reduce fracture-related morbidity and mortality. © 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","Fracture liaison service; Intervention; Osteoporosis","bone density; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; disease classification; evidence based practice; follow up; fracture liaison service; fragility fracture; health care personnel; health program; health service; human; intention to treat analysis; patient care; patient education; practice guideline; priority journal; quantitative analysis; Review; sex difference; systematic review; time to treatment; treatment outcome; fragility fracture; health care quality; integrated health care system; meta analysis; organization and management; osteoporosis; secondary prevention; bone density conservation agent; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Humans; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Secondary Prevention","Chan, D.-C.; National Taiwan University Hospital Chu-Tung BranchTaiwan; email: doctord6226@yahoo.com",,"Springer London",0937941X,,OSINE,"29525971","English","Osteoporosis Int.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043399201

Students conduct systematic reviews under the supervision of course faculty in seminar groups where both draft version and definite version of the literature review are graded/assessed. The aim of this study was to develop a systematic review of the literature rubric (SRL-rubric) for the evaluation of systematic reviews in the course of SRL in a master's Program of Health Care Sciences and to investigate students and faculty experiences with and the usability of the SRL-rubric. Methods: The SRL-rubric was developed using a seven-step approach. Usability was investigated with cross-sectional survey. Results: The SRL-rubric included nine categories and five proficiency levels. Fifty-Two of 59 students and all six faculty members at Utrecht University Program of Health Care Sciences completed the survey. Students rated the ease of working with the rubric with an average 6.6 (10-point scale). Faculty ratings ranged from 7 to 9. Problems were identified with distinction among cells describing proficiency levels and final grading. Discussion: A structured process focused on the requisite actions to develop the SRL-rubric. It was useful in writing and grading systematic reviews. However, some students indicated that they missed specific feedback and suggestions describing how to improve their weaknesses. Further development and research is needed to enhance grading reliability of SLR-rubric and to establish content validity and maintain consistency with criteria for conducting and reporting reviews,. © 2018 Education for Health | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Graduate studies; performance criteria; rating scale; rubric; systematic review","article; content validity; cross-sectional study; health education; human; human experiment; rating scale; reliability; student; systematic review; writing; cross-sectional study; curriculum; information retrieval; medical education; procedures; questionnaire; Cross-Sectional Studies; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Graduate; Information Storage and Retrieval; Surveys and Questionnaires; Systematic Reviews as Topic","Hafsteinsdóttir, T.B.; Nursing Science Program, Clinical Health Sciences; Department of Nursing Science, University Medical Center Utrecht, P.O.

Numerous studies have been conducted on this remarkable scholar and his outstanding works in Middle East and European countries, however, Indonesian studies have not been extensively highlighted. Thus, the present study aims to analyze studies conducted by Muslim Indonesian scholars on al-Razi’s works published in Indonesia between 2008 and 2016. The researcher employed Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as its main methodological tool with the adaptation of PRISMA technique. Findings revealed that Muslim Indonesian scholars mainly focused on three core subjects when they studied the works of al-Razi. The first was specific themes found in the Qur’an namely Oneness of Allah and His creation, the societal relationship in community, and Islamic philosophy on human creation. Second, comparative studies between al-Razi and other prominent Muslim scholars. Finally, the methodology used by al-Razi when interpreting the Qur’an. This study shows that Al-Razi’s works are so diverse and relevant that they are often referred to by present Indonesian Muslim scholars. Thus, it can be concluded that al-Razi’s works are very much pertinent and significant even in the modern world. © IAEME Publication.","Exegetist; Fakhr al-Din al-Razi; Indonesia; Quran; Quranic interpretation",,,,"IAEME Publication",09766308,,,,"English","Int.J.

Despite progress made towards achieving Universal Health Coverage and remarkable health gains, evidence suggests that many children in LMIC are still not accessing needed healthcare services. Delayed or lack of access to health services can lead to a worsening of health and can in turn negatively impact a child's ability to attend school, and future employment opportunities. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing access to health services for children over 5 years in LMIC settings. Four electronic databases were searched in March 2017. Studies were included if they evaluated interventions that aimed to increase: healthcare utilisation, immunisation uptake and compliance with medication/referral. Randomised controlled trials and non-randomised study designs were included in the review. Data extraction included study characteristics, intervention type and measures of access to health services for children above 5 years of age. Study outcomes were classified as positive, negative, mixed or null in terms of their impact on access outcomes. Results: Ten studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Interventions were evaluated in Nicaragua (1), Brazil (1), Turkey (1), India (1), China (1), Uganda (1), Ghana (1), Nigeria (1), South Africa (1) and Swaziland (1). Intervention types included education (2), incentives (1), outreach (1), SMS/phone call reminders (2) and multicomponent interventions (4). All evaluations reported positive findings on measured health access outcomes; however, the quality and strength of evidence were mixed. Conclusion: This review provides evidence of the range of interventions that were used to increase healthcare access for children above 5 years old in LMIC. Nevertheless, further research is needed to examine each of the identified intervention types and the influence of contextual factors, with robust study designs. There is also a need to assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions to inform decision-makers on which are suitable for scale-up in their particular contexts. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","access; adolescents; children; health care; low and middle-income country; universal health coverage","adolescence; child health; database; developing world; employment; future prospect; health care; health services; literature review; strategic approach; article; Brazil; child; China; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; data extraction; education; female; Ghana; health care access; health care utilization; health insurance; human; human experiment; immunization; India; male; middle income country; Nicaragua; Nigeria; outcome assessment; patient referral; randomized controlled trial (topic); scale up; South Africa; study design; Swaziland; systematic review; Turkey (republic); Uganda; child health care; child welfare; developing country; health care delivery; health promotion; organization and management; poverty; preschool child; statistics and numerical data; turkey (bird); Brazil; China; Ghana; India; Nicaragua; Nigeria; Swaziland; Turkey; Uganda; Brazil; Child; Child Health Services; Child Welfare; Child, Preschool; China; Developing Countries; Ghana; Health Promotion; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; India; Nigeria; Poverty; South Africa; Swaziland; Turkey; Uganda","Bright, T.; International Centre for Evidence in Disability, London School of Hygiene & Tropical MedicineUnited Kingdom; email: tess.bright@lshtm.ac.uk",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13602276,,TMIHF,"29473273","English","Trop.

Particularly in healthcare, where most processes are complex, variable, dynamic, and multi-disciplinary in nature, the application of this technique is growing yet challenging. Several literature reviews, as secondary studies, reveal the state of PM applications in healthcare from different perspectives, such as clinical pathways, oncology processes, and hospital management. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping (SM) study which we conducted to structure the information available in the primary studies. SM is a well-accepted method to identify and categorize research literature, in which the number of primary studies is rapidly growing. We searched for studies between 2005 and 2017 in the electronic digital libraries of scientific literature, and identified 172 studies out of the 2428 initially found on the topic of PM in healthcare. We created a concept map based on the information provided by the primary studies and classified these studies according to a number of attributes including the types of research and contribution, application context, healthcare specialty, mining activity, process modeling type and notation/language, and mining algorithm. We also reported the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain; namely, publication volume, top-cited papers, most contributing researchers and countries, and top venues. The results of mapping showed that, despite the healthcare data and technique related challenges, the field is rapidly growing and open for further research and practice. The researchers who are interested in the field could use the results to elicit opportunities for further research. The practitioners who are considering applications of PM, on the other hand, could observe the most common aims and specialties that PM techniques are applied. © 2013 IEEE.","Clinical pathway; healthcare process; process management; process mining; systematic mapping","Administrative data processing; Bibliographies; Data structures; Digital libraries; Enterprise resource management; Health care; Hospitals; Information management; Mapping; Medical computing; Oncology; Software engineering; Supply chains; Business process management; Clinical pathways; Healthcare process; Medical services; Process management; Process mining; Systematic mapping; Systematics; Data mining","Erdogan, T.G.; Computer Engineering Department, Hacettepe UniversityTurkey; email: tugba@cs.hacettepe.edu.tr",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046342500

More knowledge is needed on this phenomenon and it would be relevant to study its effect in asymptomatic subjects. Objectives: To compare regional effect of SM on pressure pain threshold (PPT) vs. sham, inactive control, mobilisation, another SM, and some type of physical therapy. In addition, we reported the results for the three different spinal regions. Method: A systematic search of literature was done using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane. Search terms were ((spinal manipulation) AND (experimental pain)); ((spinal manipulative therapy OR spinal manipulation) AND ((experimental pain OR quantitative sensory testing OR pressure pain threshold OR pain threshold)) (Final search: June 13th 2017). The inclusion criteria were SM performed anywhere in the spine; the use of PPT, PPT tested in an asymptomatic region and on the same day as the SM. Studies had to be experimental with at least one external or internal control group. Studies on only spinal motion or tenderness, other reviews, case reports, and less than 15 invited participants in each group were excluded. Evidence tables were constructed with information relevant to each research question and by spinal region. Results were reported in relation to statistical significance and were interpreted taking into account their quality. Results: Only 12 articles of 946 were accepted. The quality of studies was generally good. In 8 sham controlled studies, a psychologically and physiologically ""credible"" sham was found in only 2 studies. A significant difference was noted between SM vs. Sham, and between SM and an inactive control. No significant difference in PPT was found between SM and another SM, mobilisation or some type of physical therapy. The cervical region more often obtained significant findings as compared to studies in the thoracic or lumbar regions. Conclusion: SM has an effect regionally on pressure pain threshold in asymptomatic subjects. The clinical significance of this must be quantified. More knowledge is needed in relation to the comparison of different spinal regions and different types of interventions. © 2018 The Author(s).","Asymptomatic; Experimental pain; Pressure pain threshold; Spinal manipulation; Systematic review","alternative medicine; cervical spine; exercise; human; mobilization; musculoskeletal pain; outcome assessment; patient education; physiotherapy; pressure pain threshold; priority journal; psychological aspect; Review; sham procedure; spine manipulation; systematic review; thoracic spine; analysis of variance; asymptomatic disease; biomechanics; pain measurement; pain threshold; physiology; pressure; procedures; psychology; reproducibility; Analysis of Variance; Asymptomatic Diseases; Biomechanical Phenomena; Humans; Manipulation, Spinal; Pain Measurement; Pain Threshold; Pressure; Reproducibility of Results","Honoré, M.; University of Paris-Saclay, CIAMS, University of Paris-SudFrance; email: honore.margaux@ifecetud.net",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",2045709X,,,"29713457","English","Chiropr.

In spite of the growing body of literature on this issue, no synthesis of the state-of-the-art is presently available and no systematic literature review (SLR) exists that encompasses all medical specialties. This paper provides a SLR of no-shows in appointment scheduling in which the characteristics of existing studies are analyzed, results regarding which factors have a higher impact on missed appointment rates are synthetized, and comparisons with previous findings are performed. A total of 727 articles and review papers were retrieved from the Scopus database (which includes MEDLINE), 105 of which were selected for identification and analysis. The results indicate that the average no-show rate is of the order of 23%, being highest in the African continent (43.0%) and lowest in Oceania (13.2%). Our analysis also identified patient characteristics that were more frequently associated with no-show behavior: adults of younger age; lower socioeconomic status; place of residence is distant from the clinic; no private insurance. Furthermore, the most commonly reported significant determinants of no-show were high lead time and prior no-show history. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Appointments; Healthcare; No-show; Statistical analysis; Systematic review","adult; article; behavior; female; human; insurance; male; Medline; Pacific islands; Scopus; social status; statistical analysis; synthesis; systematic review; global health; hospital management; patient attitude; Appointments and Schedules; Global Health; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care","Fleck, J.L.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Marquês de São Vicente, 225, Brazil; email: jfleck@puc-rio.br",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01688510,,HEPOE,"29482948","English","Health Policy",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042369927

(Womack, J.P., Jones, D.T. and Roos, D. (1990). The Machine that Changed the World. New York, NY: Rawson Associates) popularized the Japanese manufacturing approach aimed at eliminating waste to improve operational performance and customer satisfaction. Over the years, the lean concept has evolved becoming a managerial paradigm applicable to different sectors and processes with impressive results. This heterogeneity of implementations and settings makes the recent LM literature diverse and fragmented, and an extensive analysis of the latest contributions on this field is lacking. To address this gap, the authors propose a systematic literature review (SLR) of 240 articles published in 25 peer-reviewed academic journals from January 2003 to December 2015. The purpose is to analyse the recent trends in this area and to provide a framework that organizes lean researched issues into mature, intermediate and nascent, based on their position in the research life cycle. Starting from the gaps that the SLR highlights, the authors suggest conducting lean research in the following directions: (a) grounding lean studies on existing managerial theories; (b) addressing service settings such as banking/finance, public sector and education; (c) exploring the role of national culture through cross-country comparisons; (d) defining and conceptualizing ‘lean-x’ processes; (e) understanding the relationships between lean and safety/environmental issues, and (f) unveiling the effects on social outcomes. Finally, the proposed framework helps scholars find issues not sufficiently explored that require theory-building research (to move from nascent to intermediate) or theory-testing research (to move from intermediate to mature). © 2017 British Academy of Management and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,"Romano, P.; Polytechnic Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Udine, via delle Scienze 208Italy; email: pietro.romano@uniud.it",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",14608545,,,,"English","Int.

Objective: To indirectly assess efficacy of cabozantinib versus standard-of-care (SoC) comparators in the first-line treatment of aRCC. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify randomized controlled studies in the first-line setting for aRCC. The outcomes analyzed were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted comparing OS and PFS hazard ratios (HRs). Results: Thirteen studies were identified in the SLR to be eligible for inclusion in the NMA. The overall study populations were heterogeneous in terms of risk groups; some studies included favorable risk patients. In intermediate-risk patients, HRs (95% confidence interval) for PFS were 0.52 (0.33, 0.82), 0.46 (0.26, 0.80), 0.20 (0.12, 0.36), and 0.37 (0.20, 0.68) when cabozantinib was compared with sunitinib, sorafenib, interferon (IFN), or bevacizumab plus IFN, respectively. In poor-risk patients, the NMA also demonstrated significant superiority in terms of PFS for cabozantinib; HRs were 0.31 (0.11, 0.90), 0.22 (0.06, 0.87), 0.16 (0.04, 0.64), and 0.20 (0.05, 0.88), when cabozantinib was compared with sunitinib, temsirolimus, IFN, or bevacizumab plus IFN, respectively. When the overall study populations were compared, the results were similar to the subgroup analyses. OS HRs in all analyses favored cabozantinib, but were not statistically significant. Conclusions: The results suggest that cabozantinib significantly increases PFS in intermediate-, and poor-risk subgroups when compared to standard-of-care comparators. Although overall populations included favorable risk patients in some studies, the results seen were consistent with the subgroup analyses.

The findings emphasize the unmet need for the implementation of new programs and provide recommendations for the refinement of existing ones. The study’s objectives were to evaluate fracture liaison service (FLS) programs in the Asia-Pacific region and provide recommendations for establishment of future FLS programs. A systematic literature review (SLR) of Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library (2000–2017 inclusive) was performed using the following keywords: osteoporosis, fractures, liaison, and service. Inclusion criteria included the following: patients ≥ 50 years with osteoporosis-related fractures; randomized controlled trials or observational studies with control groups (prospective or retrospective), pre–post, cross-sectional and economic evaluation studies. Success of direct or indirect interventions was assessed based on patients’ understanding of risk, bone mineral density assessment, calcium intake, osteoporosis treatment, re-fracture rates, adherence, and mortality, in addition to cost-effectiveness. Overall, 5663 unique citations were identified and the SLR identified 159 publications, reporting 37 studies in Asia-Pacific. These studies revealed the unmet need for public health education, adequate funding, and staff resourcing, along with greater cooperation between departments and physicians. These actions can help to overcome therapeutic inertia with sufficient follow-up to ensure adherence to recommendations and compliance with treatment. The findings also emphasize the importance of primary care physicians continuing to prescribe treatment and ensure service remains convenient. These findings highlight the limited evidence supporting FLS across the Asia-Pacific region, emphasizing the unmet need for new programs and/or refinement of existing ones to improve outcomes. With the continued increase in burden of fractures in Asia-Pacific, establishment of new FLS and assessment of existing services are warranted to determine the impact of FLS for healthcare professionals, patients, family/caregivers, and society. © 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","Asia-Pacific region; Fracture liaison services; Osteoporosis; Secondary fracture prevention","alendronic acid; calcium; vitamin D; bone density conservation agent; Asia; bone density; calcium intake; clinical outcome; cross-sectional study; disease burden; economic evaluation; financial management; fracture liaison service; fragility fracture; general practitioner; health care need; health care personnel; health education; health program; human; mortality; observational study; osteoporosis; patient care; patient compliance; practice guideline; prescription; priority journal; program cost effectiveness; prospective study; protocol compliance; public health service; recurrence risk; resource management; retrospective study; Review; risk assessment; secondary prevention; systematic review; Australia and New Zealand; cost benefit analysis; economics; fragility fracture; health care cost; integrated health care system; needs assessment; organization and management; osteoporosis; patient education; procedures; program evaluation; recurrent disease; statistics and numerical data; Asia; Australasia; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Health Care Costs; Humans; Needs Assessment; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Patient Education as Topic; Program Evaluation; Recurrence","Wu, C.-H.; Department of Family Medicine, National Cheng Kung University College of Medicine and Hospital, 138 Sheng-Li Road, Taiwan; email: paulo@mail.ncku.edu.tw",,"Springer London",0937941X,,OSINE,"29285627","English","Osteoporosis Int.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039545675

However, civil construction, compared to the manufacturing, still has deficiencies relating to the incorporation of new improvement systems. Thus, the use of Kaizen Events (KE) is one of the main mechanisms used to perfect processes during the production (execution) phase of a product, ensuring enhanced performance and added value to the client. The present research sought to evaluate a method for adopting KE in the construction sector. The data-gathering tools used were a questionnaire and a focus group where academics and/or experts who fit a specific profile participated. A methodological strategy for the development of the work was adopted under the approach of Design Science Research (DSR) and the theoretical referential was developed from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR).

The conventions of its miraculous nature are divided into few dimensions including scientific miracle, mathematical, legal, revealing the Ghaybiyyat (unseen world) and acoustical elements. While each elements has its general emblem and characteristic, acoustic miracle of the Quran has its own insignia. It was known with different terminology, such as phonology of the Quran, phonetic miracle and rhythm of al-Quran. Exploring the acoustical nature of the Quran, scholars of the 21st century have advancing various methods and researches in analysing its miraculous nature. Thus, the present study aims to analyse studies conducted on the acoustical elements in the Quran from 2000 to 2015. The researcher, in this study, employed Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as its main methodological tool with the adaptation of PRISMA technique. The result shows that there are three major patterns in the study of acoustical element of the Quran, which could be concluded as: (1) the study on phonetic element in the Quran that was embedded in its pronunciation, specific phonic characteristic and structural wording, (2) analysis on the organisation, repetition and rhyme at the end of verses and (3) the exploration on interrelation between the meaning of the Quran and its phonetic element. Indeed, this study is a prolegomenon in which would clear the path for further exploration in interdisciplinary or interdisciplinary studies.","Acoustical; Patterns; Phonology; Quranic rhythm; Rhetoric",,"Ahmad, H.; Faculty of Major Language Studies, Universiti Sains Islam MalaysiaMalaysia; email: hishomudin@usim.edu.my",,"IAEME Publication",09766308,,,,"English","Int.J.

New technologies (embedded sensors, artificial intelligence) give an easier access to untapped information such as passive data (i.e. that do not require patient intervention). The concept of “digital phenotype” is emerging in psychiatry: a psychomotor alteration translated by accelerometer's modifications contrasting with the usual functioning of the subject, or the graphorrhea of patients presenting a manic episode which is replaced by an increase of SMS sent. Our main objective is to highlight the digital phenotype of mood disorders by means of a selective review of the literature. Method: We conducted a selective review of the literature by querying the PubMed database until February 2017 with the terms [Computer] [Computerized] [Machine] [Automatic] [Automated] [Heart rate variability] [HRV] [actigraphy] [actimetry] [digital] [motion] [temperature] [Mood] [Bipolar] [Depression] [Depressive]. Eight hundred and forty-nine articles were submitted for evaluation, 37 articles were included. Results: For unipolar disorders, smartphones can diagnose depression with excellent accuracy by combining GPS and call log data. Actigraphic measurements showing daytime alteration in basal function while ECG sensors assessing variation in heart rate variability (HRV) and body temperature appear to be useful tools to diagnose a depressive episode. For bipolar disorders, systems which combine several sensors are described: MONARCA, PRIORI, SIMBA and PSYCHE. All these systems combine passive and active data on smartphones. From a synthesis of these data, a digital phenotype of the disorders is proposed based on the accelerometer and the GPS, the ECG, the body temperature, the use of the smartphone and the voice. This digital phenotype thus brings into question certain clinical paradigms in which psychiatrists evolve. Conclusion: All these systems can be used to computerize the clinical characteristics of the various mental states studied, sometimes with greater precision than a clinician could do. Most authors recommend the use of passive data rather than active data in the context of bipolar disorders because automatically generated data reduce biases and limit the feeling of intrusion that self-questionnaires may cause. The impact of these technologies questions the psychiatrist's professional culture, defined as a specific language and a set of common values. We address issues related to these changes. Impact on psychiatrists could be important because their unity seems to be questioned due to technologies that profoundly modify the collect and process of clinical data. © 2017","Bipolar disorder; Connected device; Depressive disorder; Digital phenotyping; Professional culture","Article; bipolar disorder; body temperature; heart rate variability; human; major depression; mood disorder; mood disorder assessment; phenotype; psychiatrist; systematic review; computer assisted diagnosis; mood disorder; organizational culture; psychiatry; psychology; trends; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Humans; Mood Disorders; Organizational Culture; Phenotype; Psychiatry","Bourla, A.; UPMC, service de psychiatrie et de psychologie médicale des adultes, hôpital Saint-Antoine, AP–HP, 184, rue du Faubourg-Saint-Antoine, France; email: alexis.bourla@aphp.fr",,"Elsevier Masson SAS",00137006,,ENCEA,"29096909","English; French","Encephale",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033730231

One of the primary reasons for mobile application development failure is the increasing number of mobile platforms; some organizations endorse mobile application development before understanding the associated development challenges of each target platform. Objective: The objective of this paper is to identify the challenges of native, web, and hybrid mobile applications, which can undermine the successful development of such applications. Method: we adopted a two-phase research approach: At first, the challenges were identified via a systematic literature review (SLR); and then, the identified challenges were validated through conducting interviews with practitioners. Results: Through both research approaches, we identified nine challenges vital to the success of mobile application development and four additional challenges from interviews not reported in the literature. A comparison of the challenges (native, web, and hybrid) identified in SLR indicates that there are slightly more differences than similarities between the challenges. On the other hand, the challenges (native, web, and hybrid) identified in interviews indicates that there are more similarities than differences between the challenges. Our results show a weak negative correlation between the ranks obtained from the SLR and the interviews ( [rs(9) =-.034] , p = 0.932 ). The results obtained from our t-Test (i.e., t = 0.868, p = 0.402 > 0.05 ) depicts that there is no significant difference between the findings of SLR and interviews. Conclusions: mobile application development organizations should try to address the identified challenges when developing mobile applications (native, web, or hybrid) to increase the probability of mobile application success. © 2013 IEEE.","challenges and barriers; empirical study; Mobile application development; mobile application software engineering; mobile apps development","Application programs; Challenges and Barriers; Empirical studies; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Mobile applications development; Mobile apps; Negative correlation; Systematic literature review (SLR); Mobile computing","Feng, C.; School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of TechnologyChina; email: fengchong@bit.edu.cn",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044852386

By increasing the popularity of touchscreen platform as an input method in mobiles phones, touch gesture behaviour is becoming more significantly important in interaction with the phone. Due to increasing demand for safer access in touchscreen mobile phones, old strategies like pins, tokens, or passwords have failed to stay abreast of the challenges. By utilizing touch gesture behaviour biometric techniques, the authentication mechanism will improve and would make it more difficult for a shoulder surfer to replay the password, even if he observes the entire gesture. The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic literature review SLR for the current state-of-the-art in the field of touch features gesture. The results of this research identified thirteen touch features followed by the previous studies (PSs) to authenticate users. However, based on the schemes followed by the previous studies (PSs) there was not any scheme that extract and use all touch features for mobile user authentication. There are number of areas of future work that could be carried out to advance upon this research and within the area of authentication on mobile devices. Each of the pervious study (PS) extracted only one or more features. The maximum number of features used in S14 year 2014 and S15 year 2015 were seven features.

The development of such systems involves design decisions that directly impact the quality of the software. For an early decision making, software developers can use model-based prediction approaches for (non-)functional quality properties. Unfortunately, the accuracy of these approaches is challenged by newly introduced hardware features like multiple cores within a single CPU (multicores) and their dependence on shared memory and other shared resources. Objectives: Our goal is to understand whether and how existing model-based performance prediction approaches face this challenge. We plan to use gained insights as foundation for enriching existing prediction approaches with capabilities to predict systems running on multicores. Methods: We perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify current model-based prediction approaches in the context of multicores. Results: Our SLR covers the software engineering, embedded systems, High Performance Computing, and Software Performance Engineering domains for which we examined 34 sources in detail. We found various performance prediction approaches which tries to increase prediction accuracy for multicore systems by including shared memory designs to the prediction models. Conclusion: However, our results show that the memory designs models are only in an initial phase.

The objective is also to help practitioners and scholars as the review revealed that little research has been conducted on selecting and implementing practices to improve resilience to counterfeiting. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the literature review, a content analysis was performed for 84 selected papers to explore the potential relationship among resilience enablers and counterfeit anti-measures. Findings: This paper contributes to Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) research by summarizing the highly fragmented literature concerning how to combat counterfeiting. The SLR indicated reengineering, collaboration, visibility, innovation, SCR culture and trust as six key enablers to combat counterfeit medicines and identified literature gaps. Moreover, the paper discusses other resilience enablers which have been less studied in the literature and shows new avenues of research. Research limitations/implications: This paper is limited in that it is an exploratory literature review and focuses only on three databases over the past 15 years. Furthermore, counterfeit is a rapidly evolving issue and anti-measure studies require frequent surveillance concerning new discoveries. Originality/value: The main contribution of this paper is to provide a better understanding of enablers most often associated with counterfeit anti-measures, which, therefore, might help to increase resilience to counterfeit medicines. Moreover, research gaps involving enablers less associated with anti-measures are presented. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Counterfeit; Intellectual capital; Pharmaceuticals; Resilience; Systematic literature review",,"Lima, F.R.P.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Federal University of Sao CarlosBrazil; email: flaviarelima@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13598546,,,,"English","Supply Chain Manage.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046036913

Transport is causing problems in urban areas, in particular in freight transport: modern cities need solutions to reduce externalities costs such as congestion, pollution and others, which have increased in the last few years, especially due to the growth of goods delivery. Online sales and globalization lead to new trends in freight transport, and moreover, a larger quantity of goods is expected to be delivered in the next future. In this context, most of the delivered goods end up in the city centers. Last mile logistics is the least efficient stage of the supply chain and comprises up to 28% of the total delivery cost. Therefore, the improvement of last mile logistics and a significant externalities reduction are very important challenges for researchers. New technologies and transport means, innovative techniques and organizational strategies allow handling in a more effective way the last mile delivery in urban areas. Based on the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, recent papers that significantly contributed, with original proposals, to the reduction of externalities in urban logistics are identified and analyzed in this work. Furthermore, a classification of the papers dealing with the externality reduction problem is presented. It is consistent with a general formulation proposed to evaluate external costs in urban area. The innovative contributions are classified into five main categories: innovative vehicles, proximity stations or points, collaborative and cooperative urban logistics, optimization of transport management and routing, innovations in public policies and infrastructures. The new paradigm of smart logistics is based on the combination of these concepts and on the proposed innovations. © 2018 by the authors.","Last mile delivery; Smart cities; Systematic Literature Review (SLR); Transport externalities; Urban logistics","cost analysis; globalization; infrastructural development; innovation; literature review; optimization; smart city; supply chain management; urban area","Digiesi, S.; Department of Mechanics, Mathematics and Management, Politecnico di BariItaly; email: salvatore.digiesi@poliba.it",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043519699

Method: Given the unique characteristics of Web content, we adapted the traditional Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology in EBSE, and conducted a review case study in the deep learning domain. Results: Our study selected four different search sources and captured 5082 'deep learning'-relevant Web documents. After a set of thematic synthesis steps ranging from keyword identification to brainstorming, the collected raw data were eventually evolved into a mind map of six semantic topics. Conclusions: We confirm that Web content can provide valuable information as supplementary evidence in EBSE. However, reviewing Web content introduces more search source bias rather than academic publications' location bias that is due to factors like ease of access or indexing levels in digital libraries. © 2017 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Evidence-based Software Engineering; Systematic Literature Review; Topic Modeling; Web Content","Deep learning; Digital libraries; Semantics; Websites; Academic publications; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Scientific publications; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Topic Modeling; Web content; Software engineering",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538626498,,,"English","Proc. - Asia-Pac.

However, the initially collected business requirements are usually expressed in natural language that creates ambiguities among different stakeholders. To overcome this problem, various business process modeling languages (BPMLs) have been introduced to represent the business requirements graphically. In this context, event-driven process chain (EPC) is a well-known BPML that supports the modeling and verification of business requirements in early automation phases. Although EPC is frequently researched to improve its modeling and verification capabilities, there is no study available yet to the best of our knowledge that examines and summarizes the latest EPC developments. Therefore, in this article, we comprehensively investigate the latest EPC approaches, trends, and tools for the modeling and verification of business requirements. Particularly, a systematic literature review is carried out to select and analyze 73 research studies published during 1998-2017. Consequently, the selected studies are classified into six categories, i.e., modeling (14), transformation (13), verification (17), general (20), semantics (5), and requirement (4). Moreover, latest EPC modeling approaches are identified and analyzed, i.e., UML (2), meta-model (3), integration (5), and EPC notations (4). Furthermore, EPC verification methods are also investigated, i.e., EPC (6), petri-nets (8), and other languages (3). Finally, 25 leading EPC tools have been presented, i.e., existing tools (14), proposed/developed tools, (5) and additional tools (6). It has been concluded that EPC provides adequate approaches and tool support for the modeling and verification of simple business requirements through atomic events. However, the complex business requirements cannot be modeled and verified through EPC due to the lack of complex event processing. Consequently, there is a strong need to include the support for the modeling and verification of complex events in EPC to manage multifaceted business requirements. © 2013 IEEE.","BPML; EPC; EPC tools; EPC verification; SLR","Analytical models; Chains; Data structures; Industry; Petri nets; Semantics; Systems engineering; Tools; Unified Modeling Language; BPML; Business process modeling languages; Complex event processing; Event driven process chain; Modeling and verifications; Object oriented model; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Modeling languages","Anwar, M.W.; Department of Computer Engineering, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences and TechnologyPakistan; email: waseemanwar@ceme.nust.edu.pk",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043353764

A systematic literature review of orbital decompression for TED.ResultsWithin the reviewed period, 93 orbits of 55 patients underwent decompression surgery for TED. There were 61 lateral (single) wall decompressions, 17 medial one-and-a-half wall, 11 two-and-a-half wall, 2 balanced two wall, and 2 orbital fat only decompressions. For the lateral (single) wall decompressions, mean reduction in exophthalmometry (95% confidence interval (CI) was 4.2 mm (3.7-4.8), for the medial one-and-a-half walls it was 2.9 mm (2.1-3.7), and for the two-and-a-half walls it was 7.6 mm (5.8-9.4). The most common complications were temporary postoperative numbness (29% of lateral decompressions, 17% of other bony decompressions, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.12-2.11) and new postoperative diplopia (9% of lateral decompressions, 39% of other bony decompressions, OR 6.8, 95% CI 1. 5-30.9). Systematic literature searching showed reduction in exophthalmometry for lateral wall surgery of 3.6-4.8 mm, with new diplopia 0-38% and postoperative numbness 12-50%. For other bony decompressions, reduction in exophthalmometry was 2.5-8.0 mm with new diplopia 0-45% and postoperative numbness up to 52%.ConclusionDiffering approaches to orbital decompression exist.

The purpose of this study is to enhance the knowledge of vital drivers for energy efficiency in this sector by providing a critical and systematic review of the empirical literature on drivers to energy efficiency in manufacturing firms at the firm level. The systematic literature review (SLR) is based on peer-reviewed articles published between 1998 and 2016. The findings reveal that organizational and economic drivers are, from the firms' perspective, the most prominent stimulus for energy efficiency and that they consider policy instruments and market drivers to be less important. Secondly, firm size has a positive effect on the firms' energy efficiency, while the literature is inconclusive considering sectorial impact. Third, the studies are mainly conducted in the US and Western European countries, despite the fact that future increase in energy demand is expected outside these regions. These findings imply a potential mismatch between energy policy-makers' and firm mangers' understanding of which factors are most important for achieving increased energy efficiency in manufacturing firms. Energy policies should target the stimulation of management, competence, and organizational structure in addition to the provision of economic incentives. Further understanding about which and how internal resources, organizational capabilities, and management practices impact energy efficiency in manufacturing firms is needed. Future energy efficiency scholars should advance our theoretical understanding of the relationship between energy efficiency improvements in firms, the related change processes, and the drivers that affect these processes. © 2018 Energies.

Further therapy options include a switch of anti-VEGF products or to corticosteroid implants, such as Fluocinolone acetonide or Dexamethasone. Objectives Firstly, to investigate systematically which evidence-based study data are available describing the efficacy of in-label treatments after primary anti-VEGF treatment, secondly, to investigate which costs go along for the healthcare provider. Methods A systematic literature review (SLR) for randomized controlled trials (RCT) was performed in Medline and Embase. A short-term cost-cost model was built in MS Excel with a 3 year time horizon to compare in-label intravitreal options Ranibizumab (Lucentis ® ), Aflibercept (Eylea ® ), Fluocinolone acetonide implant (Iluvien ® ), and Dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex ® ). Cost components comprised of drug and injection costs, optical coherence tomography (OCT) procedures, and adverse events such as endophthalmitis, IOP-lowering drugs and surgery and cataract surgery. Results A total of 42 publications of 20 RCTs were identified. No study had a clearly defined population after first line anti-VEGF treatment, thus no direct efficacy comparison was possible. In the short-term cost-cost model total costs were 17,542 € for Ranibizumab, 15,896 € for Aflibercept, 10,826 € for Fluocinolone acetonide implant and 12,365 € for Dexamethasone implant. For all treatment regimens, drug costs were the predominant cost component, followed by injection costs (with variations dependent on the specific drug) and OCT costs. In the uni- and multivariate sensitivity analyses, the results obtained were robust to changes of model inputs. Conclusions In summary, the short-term cost-cost comparison demonstrates that steroid implants can provide significant cost savings versus in-label anti-VEGF treatment for center-involving diabetic macular edema. Single application of the long-lasting Fluocinolone acetonide implant is the most cost-efficient in-label treatment option. Copyright © 2017, Georg Thieme Verlag KG.

Method: We carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) focused on identifying attributes used for measuring and predicting the capabilities of individual software engineers and teams. Results: Evidence from 16 studies showed attributes that can measure capabilities of engineers and teams, and also attributes that can be used as capability predictors. Further, different instruments used to measure those attributes were presented. Conclusions: The SLR presented a wide list of attributes that were grouped into various categories.

A web site, regardless of its category, can provide or not for users their needs. To identify its strengths and weaknesses, a process of analyzing and assessing its quality, via some criteria, is necessary. Assessing web sites is considered as a Multiple Criteria Decision Making problem (MCDM), with a massive number of criteria; a reduction phase is needed. This paper presents, firstly a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the purposes of recent researches from the assessment and determine the affected categories; secondly, it proposes a process of collecting and extracting data (criteria featuring web sites) from a list of studies. Text mining is applied for this SLR to construct a dataset. Then, a method based on Apriori algorithm is assigned and implemented to find association rules between criteria and the category of the web site, and to get a set of frequent criteria. This paper also presents a review on soft computing assessing methods. It aims to help the research community to have a scope in existing research and to derive future developments. The obtained results motivate us to further probe datasets and association rule mining. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Assessing web sites; Association rules mining; Multiple criteria decision making; Systematic literature review; Text mining","Association rules; Decision making; Soft computing; Websites; Apriori algorithms; Association rules mining; Multiple criteria decision making; Multiple criteria decision-making problems; Research communities; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Text mining; Data mining","Rekik, R.; REGIM-Lab: Research Groups in Intelligent Machines, University of Sfax, ENIS, BP 1173, Tunisia; email: rim.rekik@ieee.org",,"Elsevier Ltd",02684012,,IJMAE,,"English","Int J Inf Manage",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031735902

This umbrella systematic literature review (SLR) summarizes the current evidence on the policy determinants of PA across the life course, by pooling the results of the available SLRs and meta-analyses (MAs). Methods A systematic online search was conducted on MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Scopus and SPORTDiscus databases up to April 2016. SLRs and MAs of observational studies investigating the association between policy determinants of PA and having PA as outcome were considered eligible. The extracted data were assessed based on the importance of the determinants, the strength of evidence and the methodological quality. Results Fourteen reviews on 27 policy determinants of PA were eligible for this umbrella SLR. The majority of the reviews were of moderate quality. Among children, a clear association between time spent outdoors and PA emerged. Among adults, working hours were negatively associated with PA, though evidence was limited. At the population level, community-and street-scale urban design and land use policies were found to positively support PA levels, but levels of evidences were low. Conclusions With this umbrella SLR the policy determinants of PA at individual-level and population-level have been summarized and assessed. None of the investigated policy determinants had a convincing level of evidence, and very few had a probable level of evidence. Further research is needed, preferably by using prospective study designs, standardized definitions of PA and objective measurement of PA. © 2015 The Author.",,"adolescent; adult; age; child; Europe; exercise; female; health care policy; human; male; middle aged; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Child; Child, Preschool; Europe; Exercise; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult","Puggina, A.; Section of Hygiene, Institute of Public Health, Università Cattolica Del Sacro Cuore, L.go F.

This study reports systematic literature review of existing test case generation approaches for regression testing and agent-based software testing systems. The emphasis is articulated on agent-based regression test case generation. Further research directions are recommended. In the systematic literature review, we framed three sets of research questions. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified 115 potential research papers on test case generation in regression testing and agent-based software testing. We explored journals, international conferences, workshops and identified 59 studies in test case generation for regression testing and 56 studies in agent-based software testing. The data extracted from our study are classified into seven broader areas of agent-based software testing. Based on our systematic literature survey, we recognized available techniques, approaches, platforms as well as methodologies for regression test case generation and developing agent-based software testing systems. This study will benefit the researchers to carry forward their work in the domain of regression test case generation and agent-based software testing.

New technologies allow users to monitor behavior remotely, potentially improving reach, adherence, and outcomes. Objective: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to address the following question: are remotely delivered standalone (i.e., no human contact) interventions that use SM or TF effective in changing eating behaviors? Design: Five databases were searched in October 2016 (updated in September 2017). Only randomized controlled trials published after 1990 were included. Trials could include any adult population with no history of disordered eating which delivered an SM or TF intervention without direct contact and recorded actual dietary consumption as an outcome. Three assessors independently screened the search results. Two reviewers extracted the study characteristics, intervention details, and outcomes, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. Results were converted to standardized mean differences and incorporated into a 3-level (individuals and outcomes nested in studies) random effects meta-analysis. Results: Twenty-six studies containing 21, 262 participants were identified. The majority of the studies were judged to be unclear or at high risk of bias. The meta-analysis showed dietary improvement in the intervention group compared to the control group with a standardized mean difference of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.24; P &lt; 0.0001). The I 2 , statistic for the meta-analysis was 0.77, indicating substantial heterogeneity in results. A ""one study removed"" sensitivity analysis showed that no single study excessively influenced the results. Conclusions: Standalone interventions containing self-regulatory methods have a small but significant effect on dietary behavior, and integrating these elements could be important in future interventions. However, there was substantial variation in study results that could not be explained by the characteristics we explored, and there were risk-of-bias concerns with the majority of studies. © The Author(s) 2018.","Diet; Multilevel meta-analysis; Nutrition; Remote delivery; Self-monitoring; Systematic review; Tailored feedback","adult; article; controlled study; feeding behavior; female; human; human experiment; male; meta analysis; nutrition; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; self monitoring; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; diet; exercise; factual database; feedback system; health behavior; self control; Databases, Factual; Diet; Exercise; Feedback; Health Behavior; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Self-Control",,,"Oxford University Press",00029165,,AJCNA,"29529158","English","Am.

With the recent development of new hyperkalaemia treatments, new information on safe and effective management of hyperkalaemia has emerged. Objectives: This systematic literature review (SLR) aimed to identify all relevant comparative and non-comparative clinical data on management of hyperkalaemia in adults. Our secondary aim was to assess the feasibility of quantitatively comparing randomised controlled trial (RCT) data on the novel treatment sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (ZS) and established pharmacological treatments for the non-emergency management of hyperkalaemia, such as the cation-exchangers sodium/calcium polystyrene sulphonate (SPS/CPS). Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched on 3rd April 2017, with additional hand-searches of key congresses and previous SLRs. Articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Eligible records reported interventional or observational studies of pharmacological or non-pharmacological management of hyperkalaemia in adults. Results: Database searches identified 2,073 unique records. Two hundred and one publications were included, reporting 30 RCTs, 29 interventional non-RCTs and 43 observational studies. Interventions investigated in RCTs included ZS (3), SPS/CPS (3), patiromer (4) and combinations of temporising agents (6 RCTs). A robust and meaningful indirect treatment comparison between ZS and long-established cation-binding agents (SPS/CPS) was infeasible because of heterogeneity between studies (including time points and dosing) and small sample size in SPS/CPS studies. Conclusions: Despite hyperkalaemia being associated with several chronic diseases, there is a paucity of high-quality randomised evidence on long-established treatment options (SPS and CPS) and a limited evidence base for hyperkalaemia management with these agents. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"bicarbonate; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; docusate sodium plus phenolphthalein; glucose; insulin; patiromer; placebo; polystyrenesulfonate calcium; polystyrenesulfonate sodium; potassium; salbutamol; sodium zirconium cyclosilicate; sorbitol; spironolactone; cation exchange resin; patiromer; polymer; polystyrene derivative; polystyrenesulfonic acid; silicate; ZS-9 compound; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; human; hyperkalemia; potassium blood level; potassium intake; potassium restriction; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; treatment outcome; hyperkalemia; Cation Exchange Resins; Humans; Hyperkalemia; Polymers; Polystyrenes; Silicates","Palaka, E.; AstraZeneca LtdUnited Kingdom; email: eirini.palaka@astrazeneca.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13685031,,IJCPF,"29381246","English","Int.

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to explore how methods of elicitation impact utility values for CVD. Materials and methods: This review identified English-language articles in Embase, MEDLINE, and the gray literature published between September 1992 and August 2015 using keywords for “utilities” and “stroke”, “heart failure”, “myocardial infarction”, or “angina”. Variability in utility values based on the method of elicitation, tariff, or type of respondent was then reported. Results: This review screened 4,341 citations; 290 of these articles qualified for inclusion in the SLR because they reported utility values for one or more of the cardiovascular conditions of interest listed above. Of these 290, the 41 articles that provided head-to-head comparisons of utility methods for CVD were reviewed. In this sub-set, it was found that methodological differences contributed to variation in utility values. Direct methods often yielded higher scores than did indirect methods. Within direct methods, there were no clear trends in head-to-head studies (standard gamble [SG] vs time trade-off); but general population respondents often provided lower scores than did patients with the disease when evaluating the same health states with SG methods. When comparing indirect methods, the EQ-5D typically yielded higher values than the SF-6D, but also showed more sensitivity to differences in health states. Conclusions: When selecting CVD utility values for an economic model, consideration of the utility elicitation method is important, as this review demonstrates that methodology of choice impacts utility values in CVD. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","angina; Cardiovascular disease; EQ-5D; heart failure; myocardial infarction; standard gamble; stroke; time trade-off; utilities","acute coronary syndrome; angina pectoris; cardiovascular disease; caregiver; cerebrovascular accident; cost utility analysis; disease severity; Embase; heart failure; heart infarction; human; Medline; population; Review; systematic review; angina pectoris; cardiovascular disease; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; economic model; economics; female; health care cost; health care planning; health status indicator; heart failure; heart infarction; male; meta analysis; United States; utilization; Angina Pectoris; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Health Care Costs; Health Resources; Health Status Indicators; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Models, Economic; Myocardial Infarction; United States","Blieden Betts, M.; 500 Totten Pond RdUnited States; email: marissa.betts@evidera.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",13696998,,JMECF,"28899233","English","J.

SLR, as the name implies, is a systematic way of collecting, critically evaluating, integrating, and presenting findings from across multiple research studies on a research question or topic of interest. SLR provides a way to assess the quality level and magnitude of existing evidence on a question or topic of interest. It offers a broader and more accurate level of understanding than a traditional literature review. A systematic review adheres to standardized methodologies/guidelines in systematic searching, filtering, reviewing, critiquing, interpreting, synthesizing, and reporting of findings from multiple publications on a topic/domain of interest. The Cochrane Collaboration is the most well-known and widely respected global organization producing SLRs within the healthcare field and a standard to follow for any researcher seeking to write a transparent and methodologically sound SLR. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), like the Cochrane Collaboration, was created by an international network of health-based collaborators and provides the framework for SLR to ensure methodological rigor and quality. The PRISMA statement is an evidence-based guide consisting of a checklist and flowchart intended to be used as tools for authors seeking to write SLR and meta-analyses. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","evidence based design; healthcare design; systematic literature review","evidence based medicine; human; literature; methodology; organization and management; software; writing; Authorship; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Research Design; Review Literature as Topic; Software","Pati, D.; Texas Tech UniversityUnited States; email: d.pati@ttu.edu",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",19375867,,,"29283007","English","Health Environ.

In 2014, it was published a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding this subject. The authors of this SLR analyzed works from 2001 to 2013 and reached the number of 25 relevant papers. Therefore, the goal of our work is to provide an updated review of the state of the art based on this reference SLR work. We applied a Forward Snowballing approach, in which our seed set are the former SLR and its selected papers. We identified changes in this new review comparing it with the reference SLR: XP methodology was mentioned in just a few works; Use Case Points (UCP) method and Case Points as size metric were not found. We also observed a strong indication of solutions based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods for effort estimation in Agile Software Development (ASD). Finally, we identified that in the reference SLR there is a gap in terms of agreement on suitable cost drivers. Thus, in our updated review, we applied Thematic Analysis in the selected papers and identified a representative set of 10 cost drivers for effort estimation. © 2018 Universitat zu Koln.

Design/methodology/approach: The eight types of literature review methodologies are identified and compared. The SLR is selected after critically analyzing the eight types of literature reviews. A four-phased SLR (i.e. plan, do, analyze/synthesize, and propose) has been carried out based on the peer-reviewed journal and conference articles on leanness assessment. Findings: The existing literature on leanness assessment shows the lack of review-based papers on lean assessment. This study attempts to build a two-fold contribution to the field of leanness assessment: first, various types of themes, approaches, and assessment areas are identified; second, a framework for leanness assessment is proposed. The study shows that the research on leanness assessment is mainly empirical using qualitative judgment. The paper traces the changes in scope, areas, and approaches to leanness assessment. The scope of leanness assessment broadened from manufacturing process assessment to whole supply chain assessment including manufacturing process. The focus of earlier assessment was manufacturing and financial areas which now includes human resource, administration, new product development, suppliers, and customers also. Tool and technique based assessment has given way to outcome-based assessment using non-financial and qualitative parameters. Research limitations/implications: One of the limitations of the study is that literature search was mainly focused on peer-reviewed articles published in English language only; therefore, some papers in others languages may have been missed. Apart from this, the SLR has been conducted for the manufacturing sector only. Practical implications: The study is expected to be useful for the lean practitioners to identify the causes of reported lean failures. Moreover, the authors also expect that the conducted SLR will provide the passage to the practitioners for not only fostering the concepts on leanness assessment but also provide the vital and significant knowledge about the leanness assessment to the managers for enhancing organizational performance. Originality/value: As per the authors’ knowledge, this is the first SLR on leanness assessment.

These PPP projects have diverse attributes depending on the type of project, institutional culture, and structure of ownership and management. Based on these key aspects, the projects can either be successful or unsuccessful depending on economic and financial measures. This paper investigates the use of PPPs for the delivery of higher education institutions and finds trends of PPP usage in the United States. This is performed by first collecting records of PPP projects in educational institutions by applying the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. The result of the SLR methodology is a collection of U.S.-based higher education PPP projects and a classification of project types and where they are located. The results at this stage show that PPP projects have been used the most in the South and Northeast as compared to other geographic locations in the U.S. majority of the projects were student housing complexes for the universities and there has been a trend for expansion to other areas such as utilities, parking garages, and health centers. The results also show an increasing trend in project sizes between 1994 and 2017. This paper provides a detailed review of the use of PPPs in higher education institutions with a focus on how SLR was conducted and the identified trends. It was noticed that PPP was not only used by public universities, but also spread to private universities. The results of this paper are expected to shed light on the increased PPP usage in the educational sector in the U.S. © 2018 ASCE.",,"Garages (parking); Housing; Educational institutions; Higher education institutions; Infrastructure project; Institutional cultures; Public private partnerships; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Universities and colleges; Sustainable development",,"Lee Y.Harris R.Wang C.Harper C.Berryman C.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",,9780784481301,,,"English","Constr.

The paper also notes trends, parallels, inconsistencies and opportunities towards a clearer understanding of current scholarship. Design/methodology/approach: This SLR finds a dearth of research in the field. After parameter expansion and exclusions, 35 papers across 11 journals are reviewed. Findings: Studies of CI methodologies and practices are published infrequently, tending to focus on total quality management in European contexts. Despite the guiding customer-centric principles of CI methodologies, studies focus on improving internal processes rather than the service encounter. Research limitations/implications: The review is guided by sections of the ABS 2015 list, which excludes some journals. Books, conference papers and trade magazine articles are not reviewed. Practical implications: This paper identifies clear needs for CI research with a specific hospitality management focus, the development of CI toolkits and curricula for hospitality managers. The development and deployment of CI methodologies and practices in HTM literature and industry should lead to long-term service improvements. Originality/value: This study asserts the need for further context-specific, practice-led research into the refinement and long-term utility of CI methodologies and practices, towards demonstration of significant bottom-line industry impact.

Design/methodology/approach: Five-step process of systematic literature review (SLR) as applied by Opoku et al. (2015) is used. SLR extracted 47 studies of indirect cost after applying specified search criteria. Data regarding measurement, impact size and determinants are presented and summarised in specified tables. Findings: SLR showed that the study of indirect cost in developing countries is a literature gap. It is also found that opportunity loss, operating profit loss, market loss and risk premium are most studied indirect costs using legal definition or ex ante proxy of financial distress. However, future studies are recommended to use both non-linear leverage and ex ante proxy of financial distress. Future studies are also suggested to use the moderation technique while studying the determinants of indirect cost. Research limitations/implications: Literature selection is based on specific search criteria that can miss some of the other related literature. Originality/value: The indirect cost of financial distress is more costly and difficult to measure due to its complex concealed effects. A detailed literature of indirect cost is needed to understand the construct that eventually will help to define the future research agenda.

This work performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of current estimates practices in the development of agile software and the most used size metrics as inputs for these estimates, collecting and documenting them for a future comparison of their accuracy. With the realization of SLR, it was identified that Story Point and Point of Function are the most used metrics in agile projects as the basis for estimating size, time, effort, productivity and cost. Based on these two-size metrics, it was performed a case study with the estimation of effort, time and cost for an agile project of a software factory, where the actual development values were compared with the estimates made to analyze which provided the estimates that most closely approximated the actual values that were estimated. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

Some of these risks are specific to GSD, while others also appear in co-localized environments but are aggravated in GSD. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted to identify the risks to RE that occur in GSD, along with the safeguards with which to manage these risks. Inspired by a grounded theory approach, risks and safeguards have been elicited and grouped by means of collaborative tagging and cluster analysis techniques, and then bivariate correlation tests have been applied to measure the association between these risks and safeguards. The results of the SLR include the identification of a great variety of risks to RE in GSD (218), along with a large number of safeguards (146 in total). Starting from these results, a risks and safeguards repository that encompasses the entire state of the art on RE in GSD has been produced and is now publicly available. This repository can be used as a growing knowledge base by any organization interested in carrying out RE in GSD. The objective is to assist those organizations that are inexperienced in GSD to handle the problems that may arise when involved in a global development. The most common risks identified in the literature are related to: 1) knowledge sharing; 2) client and vendor relationships; 3) problems with process definition; and 4) communication problems. It was also found that in the literature, the risks related to management and project coordination, knowledge management and awareness, socio-cultural differences, and client-vendor distance are the ones most lacking in proposed safeguards; these are therefore concerns to which more attention should be paid. © 2018 IEEE.","Global software development; quantitative analysis; requirements engineering; risks and safeguards; systematic literature review","Bibliographies; Chemical analysis; Cluster analysis; Computer software; Encoding (symbols); Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Requirements engineering; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Software design; Cluster analysis technique; Collaboration; Global software development; Grounded theory approach; Quantitative assessments; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematics; Risk assessment","Carrillo De Gea, J.M.; Department of Computer Science and Systems, University of MurciaSpain; email: jmcdg1@um.es",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054488342

Design/methodology/approach: The authors have utilised an SLR methodology proposed by Denyer and Tranfield (2009). A total of 23 papers published in 18 scientific journals have been systematically reviewed for evaluating and establishing the current status of Lean for airport services. Findings: It was observed that there are no journal publications on the use of Lean in UK airport services. Although value stream mapping has been widely accepted as a powerful Lean tool across many service organisations, its applications in airport services is in its early stages. One of the biggest challenges in the implementation of Lean for airport services is about maintaining the level of service standards. The most common barriers in the implementation of Lean for airport services may include: resistance to change, varied definitions of the term Lean for different people across the business and understanding the need for Lean in airport services as there is a misconception that Lean is confined to manufacturing. Research limitations/implications: This paper seeks to contribute to and broaden the limited body of evidence of the applicability of Lean to airport services and identify areas for further research and review. Originality/value: This paper makes an attempt to demonstrate the use of Lean thinking for service industries and, in particular, airport services. The authors have identified less than five papers on the use of Lean thinking in airport services and this paper sets the foundation for future research on the use of process excellence methodologies such as Lean. Moreover, the authors firmly believe that the results of this SLR can be extremely beneficial to many managers working in Airport Service contexts, irrespective of the country and culture of the organisation. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Airport services; Lean; Lean services; Systematic literature review",,"Antony, J.; School of Social Sciences, Department of Business Management, Heriot-Watt UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: j.antony@hw.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0265671X,,,,"English","Int.

Thus, there is a need to adopt KM to the software testing core processes and attain the benefits that it provides in terms of cost, quality, etc. Aim: To investigate the usage and implementation of KM for software testing. The major objectives include 1. To identify various software testing aspects that receive more attention while applying KM. 2. To analyse multiple software testing techniques, i.e. test design, test execution and test result analysis and highlight KM involvement in these. 3. To gather challenges faced by industry due to the lack of KM initiatives in software testing. Method: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted utilizing the guidelines for snowballing reviews by Wohlin. The identified studies were analysed in relation to their rigor and relevance to assess the quality of the results. Results: The initial resulting set provided 4832 studies. From these, 35 peer-reviewed papers were chosen among which 31 are primary, and 4 are secondary studies. The literature review results indicated nine testing aspects being in focus when applying KM within various adaptation contexts and some benefits from KM application. Several challenges were identified, e.g., improper selection and application of better-suited techniques, a low reuse rate of software testing knowledge, barriers in software testing knowledge transfer, no possibility to quickly achieve the most optimum distribution of human resources during testing, etc. Conclusions: The study brings supporting evidence that the application of KM in software testing is necessary, e.g., to increase test effectiveness, select and apply testing techniques. The study outlines the testing aspects and testing techniques that benefit their users.","KM; Knowledge; Software testing; Systematic literature review","Application programs; Computer software reusability; Knowledge management; Testing; Knowledge; Literature reviews; Rigor and relevances; Software testing techniques; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Test effectiveness; Testing knowledge; Software testing",,,"Politechnika Wroclawska",18977979,,,,"English","E-Informatica",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039856186

Universities at some points provide entrepreneurship skills to their students so as to prepare the students on setting up their own businesses instead of depending and relying on getting paid jobs in their chosen industries. However, Social entrepreneurship is different from traditional entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship does not look at the profit only, but focuses on the impact of business to the society while on the other hand, traditional entrepreneurship deals with the implementation of such ideas to do business and get more profit. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the importance of social entrepreneurship in higher education via a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach adopted from Kitchenham (2004). This paper offers systematic investigation into the importance and approaches of social entrepreneurship in higher education using extant literature as the basis of analysis and discussion. The importance of social entrepreneurship in higher education can produce graduates that have significant knowledge and skills of being a social entrepreneur as well as have relevant disciplinary knowledge and skills, ethics and morality. There are many approaches that are being used by the universities to help these students.

Hence, the purpose of this paper is to utilize a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the SCR research trends and gaps within the management literature. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the research objective an SLR, looking into 25 years since 1990, into supply chain risk management (SCRM) was conducted, which resulted in 114 papers. Findings: While the SCRM literature is growing, results from the SLR identified limited organized understanding of what constitutes a holistic SCR process, and high reliance of particular categories for SCR, such as the high reliance on specific country settings (the USA and the UK); limited presence of cross competitive SCR process analysis and challenges in developing conceptual SCR frameworks. Research limitations/implications: The SCR embeds categories of location, scope of supply chain, risk management tools, and the industry sectors involved. The search for related publications was mainly used from a wide range of coverage from accountancy to design in SCR; hence, although there is indication to specific industries, and foci of risk, this could be explored further. Practical implications: This review of SCRM identifies various research gaps and directions for future research to develop theory and a practical understanding of SCR. Originality/value: The current literature on SCR has been assessed based on its definition and utilization. The current paper bridges this gap by synthesizing the diverse academic journal papers into the categories based on the design continuum, relationship continuum, process continuum and economic continuum. In addition, it highlights the gaps in industry context, theoretical contribution, geographic location, and research methods applied and addresses the scope for further research. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Literature review; Risk; Risk management; Structured literature review; Supply chain",,"Bak, O.; Business School, University of HuddersfieldUnited Kingdom; email: o.bak@hud.ac.uk",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14637154,,,,"English","Bus.

The goal of the present literature survey is to identify and compare existing test estimation techniques for traditional software (desktop/laptop) and for mobile software/application. The characteristics that make mobile software/application different from traditional software are identified in this literature survey. Further, the trend for developing the software is towards agile, thus this study also presents and compares estimation techniques used in agile software development for mobile applications. The analysis of literature review suggests filling a research gap to present formal models for estimating mobile application considering specific characteristics of mobile software. © 2018 The Authors","Agile; Estimation; Mobile Applications; Systematic literature review; Test effort",,"Kaur, A.; 60, Kabir Park, opp. Guru Nanak Dev UniversityIndia; email: anumahal@gmail.com",,"King Saud bin Abdulaziz University",13191578,,,,"English","J.

Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was performed with a sensitive bibliographic search strategy in Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Library. We selected randomized clinical trials that analyzed the efficacy and/or safety of 1) combined therapy of synthetic compared with sequential therapy of synthetic DMARD in early RA; and 2) combination of methotrexate + leflunomide or triple therapy with synthetic DMARD in established RA refractory to synthetic DMARD. Two reviewers made the first selection by title and abstract and 11 performed the selection after detailed review of the articles and data collection. The quality of the studies was evaluated with the Jadad scale. Based on the results, related recommendations were agreed upon in a nominal group meeting. Results: Ultimately, no articles were included in the SLR. The analysis of the reviewed articles demonstrated the effectiveness of the treatment with synthetic DMARD following a “treat to target” strategy in early RA patients, and of combination therapy of synthetic DMARD in established RA refractory to synthetic DMARD. This resulted in 6 recommendations concerning combination therapy with synthetic DMARD. Conclusions: These recommendations aim to facilitate decision-making with the use of combined therapy with DMARD in RA. © 2018 Elsevier España, S.L.U. and Sociedad Española de Reumatología y Colegio Mexicano de Reumatología","Combined therapy; Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; Rheumatoid arthritis; Systematic literature review",,"Calvo Alén, J.; Servicio de Reumatología, Hospital Universitario ArabaSpain; email: jcalvo@ser.es",,"Ediciones Doyma, S.L.",1699258X,,,,"English; Spanish","Reumatol.

Experience has proven that, while theory-driven approaches are able to comprehend and justify a model's choices, such models frequently fail to encompass necessary features because of a lack of insight of the model builders. In contrast, data-driven approaches rely much less on expertise, and thus offer certain potential advantages. Hence, this study conducts a systematic review of the extant research on data-driven approaches to game player modeling. To this end, we have assessed experimental studies of such approaches over a nine-year period, from 2008 to 2016; this survey yielded 46 research studies of significance.We found that these studies pertained to three main areas of focus concerning the uses of data-driven approaches in game player modeling. One research area involved the objectives of data-driven approaches in game player modeling: behavior modeling and goal recognition. Another concerned methods: classification, clustering, regression, and evolutionary algorithm. The third was comprised of the current challenges and promising research directions for data-driven approaches in game player modeling. © 2018 ACM.","Computational models; Data-driven approaches; Game player modeling; Systematic literature review (SLR)","Computer science; Surveys; Computational model; Data-driven approach; Game players; Research studies; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Theory driven approaches; Computation theory",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",03600300,,ACSUE,,"English","ACM Comput Surv",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040162683

Organizations are facing increasingly larger and more complex processes, which pose difficulties to the understandability of process models. The literature reports several factors that are considered to influence the understandability of process models. However, these studies typically focus on testing of a limited set of factors. A work that collects, abstracts and synthesizes an in-depth summary of the current literature will help in developing the research in this field. Objective We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) focusing on the empirical studies in the existing literature in order to better understand the state of the research on process model understandability, and identify the gaps and opportunities for future research. Method We searched the studies between the years 1995 and 2015 in established electronic libraries. Out of 1066 publications retrieved initially, we selected 45 publications for thorough analysis. We identified, analyzed and categorized factors that are considered to influence the understandability of process models as studied in the literature using empirical methods. We also analyzed the indicators that are used to quantify process model understandability. Results Our analysis identifies several gaps in the field, as well as issues of inconsistent findings regarding the effect of some factors, unbalanced emphasis on certain indicators, and methodological concerns. Conclusions The existing research calls for comprehensive empirical studies to contribute to a better understanding of the factors of process model understandability. Our study is a comprehensive source for researchers working on the understandability of process models and related fields, and a useful guide for practitioners aiming to generate understandable process models. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Business process model; Comprehension; Process model understandability; Systematic literature review; Understandability","Information systems; Software engineering; Business process model; Comprehension; Process model understandability; Systematic literature review; Understandability; Digital libraries","Dikici, A.; TUBITAK BILGEM Software Technologies Research InstituteTurkey; email: ahmet.dikici@tubitak.gov.tr",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029563530

Ergonomics data were extracted from the literature. Ergonomics were tested face-to-face. Results The SLR extracted 7 tools. Two instruments were considered sufficiently effective and reliable for use: the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist-25 (HSCL-25). After testing face-to-face, HSCL-25 was selected. A multicultural consensus on one diagnostic tool for depression was obtained for the HSCL-25. This tool will provide the opportunity to select homogeneous populations for European collaborative research in daily practice. © 2018, The Author(s).","Delphi procedure; Depression diagnosis tool; Multicultural consensus; RAND/UCLA appropriateness method","consensus; Delphi study; depression; Europe; human; psychological rating scale; standards; Consensus; Delphi Technique; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Europe; Humans; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales","Nabbe, P.; EA 7479 SPURBO, Department of General, Practice Université de Bretagne OccidentaleFrance; email: patrice.nabbe@univ-brest.fr",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17560500,,,"29298721","English","BMC Res.

Several studies have investigated the use of reminders to prevent such failures on the patients' side. This article presents a systematic review of the literature concerning reminders in physical therapy. Methods: Databases were searched until May 2017 and literatures were found from April 1992 until 2017. The literature recruitment strategy was based on applying several keywords and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) combination running against title and abstract, including concepts such as reminder, physical therapy. The finally selected articles were categorized through reminder aspects such as how, who feedback. Data were extracted according to PRISMA guidelines. Results: In 47% of studies, the reminder was sent to the patients, 29% to the physical therapists and 12% to the caretaker team. In 24% of the studies, paper-based letters were main medium for reminders while the rest were various types of media like emails and SMS mobile text messages. 35% of the articles showed positive effects of the reminders. Conclusions: Many reminder methods consisted of SMS, phone calls, letters, emails and notices on the wall were used in physical therapy. Reminders may be used to improve patients' adherence to exercise programs.","Physical therapy; Reminder; Systematic review","adult; e-mail; exercise; female; human; male; Medical Subject Headings; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; practice guideline; reminder system; rest; running; systematic review","Javanshir, K.; Department of Physiotherapy, Babol University of Medical SciencesIran; email: kjavanshir@yahoo.com",,"Babol University of Medical Sciences",20086164,,,,"English","Caspian J.

It is theorized that CW leads to ischemic stroke secondary to blood flow stasis and subsequent embolization. The natural history and optimal management of CW are unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of CW. Methods-Our librarians performed a SLR for CW and related terminology. Patient-level demographics, stroke risk factors, neuroimaging findings, stroke recurrence or stroke free-duration, and treatment modality were extracted. We used descriptive statistics to characterize our results. When specific patient-level metrics were not reported, the denominators for reporting percentage calculations were adjusted accordingly. Results-Our literature search produced 1150 articles. Thirty-seven articles including 158 patients (median age 46 years [range 16-85], 68% women, 76% symptomatic) met entry criteria and were included in our SLR. Of the symptomatic CW patients: 57% did not have stroke risk factors, 56% who received medical therapy had recurrent stroke (median 12 months, range 0-97), and 72% were ultimately treated with carotid revascularization (50% carotid stenting, 50% carotid endarterectomy). There were no periprocedural complications or recurrent strokes in carotid revascularization patients. Conclusions-CW leads to ischemic stroke in younger patients without conventional stroke risk factors. We found a high stroke recurrence rate in medically managed symptomatic CW patients, whereas carotid revascularization effectively prevented recurrent stroke. Our findings should be interpreted with caution because of risk of publication and reporting bias. © 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.","Brain ischemia; Carotid arteries; Fibromuscular dysplasia; Risk factors; Stroke","anticoagulant agent; warfarin; anticoagulant therapy; brain ischemia; carotid artery stenting; carotid endarterectomy; carotid web; cerebrovascular accident; fibromuscular dysplasia; human; Medline; priority journal; recurrent disease; revascularization; Review; risk factor; secondary prevention; systematic review; Asian continental ancestry group; asymptomatic disease; Black person; brain ischemia; carotid artery disease; carotid artery obstruction; Caucasian; cerebrovascular accident; ethnology; fibromuscular dysplasia; intima; sex ratio; stent; African Continental Ancestry Group; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Asymptomatic Diseases; Brain Ischemia; Carotid Artery Diseases; Carotid Stenosis; Endarterectomy, Carotid; European Continental Ancestry Group; Fibromuscular Dysplasia; Humans; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Secondary Prevention; Sex Distribution; Stents; Stroke; Tunica Intima","Streib, C.; Department of Neurology, University of Minnesota Medical School, 420 Delaware St SE, MMC 296, United States; email: streib@umn.edu",,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",00392499,,SJCCA,"30571430","English","Stroke",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058915475

Design/methodology/approach: A two-step approach was used in this research work. A systematic literature review (SLR) was used to find relevant references related to Hoshin Kanri that could serve as sources for recommendations. After completing the SLR, content analysis was used to define the recommendations and analyze them, deriving a set of guidelines. Findings: A collection of recurring topics was identified through content analysis. These topics can be interpreted as central aspects for Hoshin Kanri application. Topics were eventually categorized and one guideline was developed for each one of the categories, which resulted in a total of 23 guidelines. Guidelines were grouped in two dimensions (context and process) and also according to their central aspect (organizational culture, capabilities, focus, alignment, integration and review). Originality/value: Although Hoshin Kanri has been widely applied in Japan and also in large companies over the past 50 years, it is not as widely explored in research papers as other frameworks. Literature often focuses on Hoshin Kanri only as a process and not as an organization-wide holistic system. There are few empirical studies about its conceptual assumptions and practical implications and no systematization of the main aspects that ensure the effective application of Hoshin Kanri in a universal manner. © 2018, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Guidelines; Hoshin Kanri; Strategy deployment",,"Deschamps, F.; Industrial and Systems Engineering Graduate Program, Pontifical Catholic University of ParanáBrazil; email: fernando.deschamps@terra.com.br",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17410401,,,,"English","Int.

The process of test case generation becomes more expensive and time-consuming when the test suites become larger. Many researchers have proposed the test case prioritization (TCP) technique to schedule test cases, so that those with the highest priority are executed first before lower priority test cases. One of the performance goals of TCP is the rate of fault detection, which is a measure of how quickly faults are detected within the testing phase. However, the existing TCP technique has some limitations. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) of relevant primary studies as evidence of the existence of TCP in the area of event sequences. Consequently, five major techniques and 10 factors were identified and analysed. This study aims to review and identify techniques and factors that influence the process of assigning weight values in TCP processes. The proposed factors need to be evaluated in terms of their contribution to the performance of the TCP technique. Some researchers believe that a combination of factors might be required to produce unique weights during the TCP processes. Nevertheless, most studies applied the random method or did not provide any information regarding the same weight value issues. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka.

It is also commonly used in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia spectrum disorders. With increasing administration, reports of intoxications are more frequently reported. The most common findings of VPA intoxication are central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, hypotension, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate, among others. Methods: We describe a case report of VPA intoxication with hemodiafiltration (HDF) as extracorporeal treatment (ECTR) for removal of VPA. This treatment modality has only rarely been reported in the current literature. In addition, we performed an updated systematic literature review (SLR) of additional cases on the topic ranging from December 1st, 2014 to April 20th, 2018. We searched MEDLINE and Web of Science for relevant references. Results: In the presented case, VPA intoxication occurred in a 46-year-old female patient after oral ingestion of 56 g of VPA. In addition to vasopressors and endotracheal intubation, we administered L-Carnitine (L-Car) and performed hemodiafiltration treatment. After intravenous therapy with L-Car and simultaneous HDF sessions, we observed full recovery without neurological sequelae. The SLR identified 8 additional articles reporting favorable outcomes with extracorporeal treatments in most cases. Conclusion: HDF and other extracorporeal procedures are safe and effective therapeutic options in patients with VPA intoxication. The choice of ECTR modality mainly depends on local experience and the setting. In the present case, ingestion of 56 g was successfully treated with HDF. These findings are in line with several other case reports describing positive outcomes. Extracorporeal treatment, including HDF, should be considered early in the management of VPA intoxication. Supporting evidence is emerging, but it is of limited quality. © 2018 Tichelbäcker, Herath, Tampe and Korsten.","Extracorporeal treatment; Hemodiafiltration; Hemodialysis; Intoxication; Valproic acid",,"Korsten, P.; Department of Nephrology and Rheumatology, University Medical CenterGermany; email: peter.korsten@med.uni-goettingen.de",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2296858X,,,,"English","Front.

Design/methodology/approach: This comprehensive review follows the systematic literature review approach. Findings: The authors find SSCM to develop around five principal facets. The first facet is adoption, which accounts for the development of preparatory grounds – for facilitating the generation of a SSCM philosophy to gradually seep into the frame of traditional supply chain management (SCM). The second facet of implementation accounts for the manifestation of a SSCM-oriented transformation for producing gradual upgrades in the traditional SCM environment. The third facet of extension signifies the broadening of the scope of implementation at a more wider (supply chain) level. The fourth facet of maintenance outlines the need for ensuring the continuity of progress in the course of SSCM development. The fifth facet of outcomes focuses on the yields of SSCM’s pursuit. Originality/value: These principal facets are built across the multiple levels and unique conceptual standpoints as propagated by 13 themes and 34 sub-themes. These themes are generated based upon 419 articles (2000-2017) from more than 40 leading journals. The authors discuss the facet-specific key implications for guiding the literature in its further advancement, and thus propose a rigorous thematic landscape of the SSCM literature with a unique approach.

Firstly, an analysis of the literature discussing the current EA adoption models was undertaken. The EA adoption models were reviewed to identify which adoption phase can be connected. This paper also discusses the limitations of the models. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in the review process, 13 articles were reviewed. There are 13 different EA adoption models across the number of adoption phases which were selected from 13 articles. A total of 11 adoption models were designed for the post-adoption phase and applicable for the EA implementation phase and two (2) adoption models were formulated for adoption phase. This SLR reflected that there was relatively little research conducted in the adoption phase. Previous scholars had adopted one or a combination of different underpinning theories in their studies to identify the existing approach and perspective formulating EA adoption model. The finding also revealed the limitation of previous studies such as generalizability and fragmented perspective. Therefore, this review will provide further investigation into the potential development of EA adoption model at an early stage that could provide wide-ranging and rational views of business, information, and technology for the organisation. © 2018 Authors.","Adoption model; Business and technology; Enterprise architecture; Systematic review",,"Ahmad, N.A.; Department of Information System, College of Computer Science and Information Technology, Universiti Tenaga NasionalMalaysia; email: Norazizah.ahmad@gmail.com",,"Science Publishing Corporation Inc",2227524X,,,,"English","Int.

Currently the changes driven by technology and especially by the innovation generated from the technological application, make it necessary for universities to update their organizational structures in order to be relevant for the regions to which they belong. The objective of this work was to review the literature regarding systemic models of innovation that are relevant for regional universities, characterized by an under-entrepreneurial environment and with deficient support by the government. A systematic literature review (SLR) was carried out, this methodology guaranteed that the subject was evaluated in a rigorous, reliable and auditable manner. The main theoretical references found are: Knowledge networks, open innovation, hub and social innovation. In conclusion, an innovation model for regional universities is proposed based on the theoretical referents found and with a systemic approach that allows its evolution and adaptation to the region.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) is presented focussing on empirical studies on IC published in the period 1960-2016. A protocol for action is defined and a research question is raised, gathering data from the databases of: Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. A social network analysis is also provided to determine the type of networks embracing groups, IC individual components and performance type. Findings: Of the 777 papers included in the SLR, 189 deal with the relationship between IC and performance. The paper highlights the greater development of empirical studies starting from 2004; the organisational MAA is the most studied. The most frequently used groups of components in studies dealing with IC’s influence on performance corresponds to a triad of human capital; structural (organisational or process) capital; and relational (social or customer) capital, which determine positively the performance of organisations/regions/countries, but their influence is not linear and depends on various factors associated with the context and surrounding environment. Practical implications: This study has wide-ranging implications for politicians/governments, managers and academics, providing empirical evidence about the relationships between the components of IC and performance, by MAAs, and a global vision and better understanding of how those IC components have developed and how they are related to performance. Originality/value: Due to the high number of references covering a wide range of disciplines and the various dimensions (e.g. organisational, regional and national) that form IC, it becomes fundamental to carry out an SRL and systematise its MAAs to deepen knowledge about what has been discovered/developed in this domain, in terms of empirical studies, in order to situate the topic in a wider theoretical-practical context. The paper is exceptionally wide-ranging, covering the period 1960-2016. It is one of the first clarifying studies on systemisation of the literature on IC, by MAA, and an in-depth study of IC’s impact on the performance of organisations/regions and countries which may serve as a guideline for future studies using the taxonomy proposed. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Intangible assets; Intellectual capital; Performance; Systematic review",,"Pedro, E.; Department of Management and Economics, University of Beira InteriorPortugal; email: eugenia@ubi.pt",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14691930,,,,"English","J.

This systematic literature review (SLR) identified RCTs evaluating β-3 adrenergic agonists or muscarinic antagonists in elderly patients with OAB, and compared study quality across trials. Methods: MEDLINE®, Embase®, and Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Clinical Trials databases were searched from inception through April 28, 2015 to identify published, peer-reviewed RCT reports evaluating β-3 adrenergic agonists or muscarinic antagonists in elderly OAB patients (either ≥65 years or study-described as “elderly”). To assess study quality of RCT reports, we focused on internal/external validity, assessed via two scales: the validated Effective Public Health Practice Project [EPHPP]): Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies, and a tool commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Results: Database searches yielded 1380 records that were then screened according to predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. We included eight papers meeting study criteria. Despite scientific community efforts to improve RCT reporting standards, published reports still include incomplete and inconsistent reporting—of subject attrition, baseline patient characteristics, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and other important details. Only three of the eight OAB RCTs in this review received quality ratings of Strong (EPHPP) or Fair (AHRQ) and were multicenter with large samples. Conclusions: Despite the prevalence of OAB among older age individuals, relatively few RCTs evaluate OAB treatments explicitly among elderly subjects. The findings from this quality assessment suggest some areas for improvement in both conduct and reporting of future RCTs assessing OAB treatment in elderly. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","elderly patients; evidence quality; overactive bladder; randomized controlled trials; systematic literature review","beta 3 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; darifenacin; fesoterodine; imidafenacin; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; oxybutynin; placebo; propiverine; solifenacin; tolterodine; trospium chloride; beta 3 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; aged; confounding variable; external validity; human; internal validity; overactive bladder; patient dropout; patient selection; quality control; randomization; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; selection bias; systematic review; overactive bladder; Adrenergic beta-3 Receptor Agonists; Aged; Humans; Muscarinic Antagonists; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Urinary Bladder, Overactive","Kistler, K.D.; EvideraUnited States; email: kristin.kistler@evidera.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc.",07332467,,NEURE,"28763112","English","Neurourol.

Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was developed to guide the systematic literature review (SLR) that was conducted in MEDLINE and Embase databases. A two step search strategy was implemented including two searches based on previously completed reviews. Studies published from 2006 to 2017 were synthesized using a framework based on the ISOQOL PRO Implementation Guide. Results: After screening 4427 abstracts, 36 studies met the eligibility criteria. Most elements of the ISOQOL PRO Implementation Guide were followed. Two notable exceptions were found: 1) providing PRO score interpretation guidelines (39% of studies); and 2) providing patient-management guidance for addressing issues identified by PROs (25% of studies). Of the 22 studies with an intervention component, 19 (86%) reported intervention effects on study outcomes. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) was the most commonly used PRO (n = 10, 28%); use of 38 other PRO measures was also reported. Only three studies (8%) reported real-world PRO implementation. Conclusion: Reports of real-world PRO implementation are limited. Reports from studies conducted in clinical settings suggest gaps in information on PRO score interpretation and the use of PRO results to inform patient management.

There is a wealth of developing cloud benefit assets that makes it difficult for the user to select the best administration related to own applications in an evolving multiple cloud environment, particularly for online processing applications. To make clients to choose their interested cloud adequately, we need a model which holds the cloud profits, and hence dynamic cloud benefit determination procedure named Dynamic Cloud Selection (DCS) is adapted. In this procedure of selected services, every cloud benefit business deals with some group of cloud administrations, and executes the DCS method. This paper studies the cloud selection and proposed a way to improve the cloud selection based on related measures. The measures are reliability, response time, throughput, availability, utilization, resilience, scalability, and elasticity. The system is contrived to enhance the cloud benefit choice powerfully and to restore the best administration result to the client. These measures are used to form best selection strategy. User memory requirement is also considered to improve the preferred task. Experimental results proved that using this new strategy, best cloud selection is made efficiently. © 2018 Authors.","Adaptive Learning Mechanism; Degenerate; Forgetting; Incentive; Remembrance; Systematic Literature Review (SLR)",,"Maruthi, V.; Department of CSE, SASTRA Deemed to be UniversityIndia; email: maruthicse83@gmail.com",,"Science Publishing Corporation Inc",2227524X,,,,"English","Int.

Although vaccination may prevent numerous infections, vaccination uptake rates are low in this group of patients. Objectives: To develop evidence-based recommendations for vaccination in SIRD patients. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (until 31 October 2014) and EMBASE (until 14 December 2014) databa - ses, as well as the ACR and EULAR congress abstracts (2011-2014). Patients with any systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease were included and all vaccines were considered. Any safety and efficacy outcomes were admitted. Search results were submitted to title and abstract selection, followed by detailed review of suitable studies. Data were subsequently pooled accor - ding to the type of vaccine and the SIRD considered. Results were presented and discussed by a multidisciplinary panel and systematic literature review (SLR)- -derived recommendations were voted according to the Delphi method. The level of agreement among rheumatologists was assessed using an online survey. Results: Eight general and seven vaccine-specific re - commendations were formulated. Briefly, immunization status should routinely be assessed in all SIRD patients. The National Vaccination Program should be followed and some additional vaccines are recommended. To maximize the efficacy of vaccination, vaccines should preferably be administered 4 weeks before starting immunosuppression or, if possible when disease activity is controlled. Non-live vaccines are safe in SIRD, including immunosuppressed patients. The safety of live attenuated vaccines in immunosuppressed patients deserves further ascertainment, but might be considered in particular situations. Discussion: The present recommendations combine scientific evidence with the multidisciplinary expertise of our taskforce panel and attained desirable agreement among Portuguese rheumatologists. Vaccination re - commendations need to be updated on a regular basis, as more scientific data regarding vaccination efficacy and safety, emergent infectious threats, new vaccines as well as new immunomodulatory therapies become available. © 2001-2018 Sociedade Portuguesa de Reumatologia.","Antirheumatic agents; Biological products; Immunosuppressive agents; Recommendations; Rheumatic diseases; Vaccination",,,,"Sociedade Portuguesa de Reumatologia",0303464X,,ARUPB,,"English","Acta Reumatol.

The study aims to identify the key factors and holistic understanding of how a factor influences Consumption Pattern (CP) effectiveness for an android platform mobile application. The study presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on existing studies that examined factors influencing the effectiveness of CP for android mobile application and measured the effectiveness of CP. Therefore, the current SLR is conducted to answer the following questions: (1) What is the evidence of CP factors that drain the battery of a mobile device? (2) What are the energy conservation techniques to overcome all the factors that drain battery life? and (3) How can developers measure the effectiveness of an energy conservation technique?. The SLR investigated factors affecting the effectiveness of CP for android platform mobile application. The analyses of forty papers were used in our synthesis of the evidence related to the research questions above. Therefore, the analyses showed 22 studies that investigated how to measure the energy conservation technique effectiveness while 18 studies focused on better understanding of how the resources of mobile devices are actually spent. In this sense, 2 studies show the effectiveness of early analysis of software application design. Additionally, five factors i.e., architecture, interface, behavior of the application, resources, and network technologies that affect CP effectiveness were identified. This study investigated a SLR targeting at studies of CP effectiveness in android platform. The total of 40 studies were identified and selected for result synthesis purpose in this work (SLR). The evidences show there are five factors affecting the CP’s effectiveness. Three of them have received a little attention among developers regarding choosing the most suitable: software architecture, application interface and behavior of the application in terms of resource consumption. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Android mobile application; Energy conservation technique; Energy consumption patterns; Systematic literature review",,,,"Asian Research Publishing Network",19928645,,,,"English","J.

Knowing factors associated with PA might help reducing the disease and economic burden caused by low activity. Studies suggest that socio-cultural factors may affect PA, but systematic overviews of findings across the life course are scarce. This umbrella systematic literature review (SLR) summarizes and evaluates available evidence on socio-cultural determinants of PA in children, adolescents, and adults. Methods: This manuscript was drafted following the recommendations of the 'Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses' (PRISMA) checklist. The MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases were searched for SLRs and meta-analyses (MAs) on observational studies published in English that assessed PA determinants between January 2004 and April 2016. The methodological quality was assessed and relevant information on socio-cultural determinants and any associations with PA was extracted. The available evidence was evaluated based on the importance of potential determinants and the strength of the evidence. Results: Twenty SLRs and three MAs encompassing 657 eligible primary studies investigated potential socio-cultural PA determinants, with predominantly moderate methodological quality. Twenty-nine potential PA determinants were identified that were primarily assessed in children and adolescents and investigated the micro-environmental home/household level. We found probable evidence that receiving encouragement from significant others and having a companion for PA were associated with higher PA in children and adolescents, and that parental marital status (living with partner) and experiencing parental modeling were not associated with PA in children. Evidence for the other potential determinants was limited, suggestive, or non-conclusive. In adults, quantitative and conclusive data were scarce. Conclusions: A substantial number of SLRs and MAs investigating potential socio-cultural determinants of PA were identified. Our data suggest that receiving social support from significant others may increase PA levels in children and adolescents, whereas parental marital status is not a determinant in children. Evidence for other potential determinants was limited. This was mainly due to inconsistencies in results on potential socio-cultural determinants of PA across reviews and studies.

This is a tertiary study that follows the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process as put forth by Kitchenham in her seminal paper, based on five criteria: estimation technique, estimation accuracy, type of dataset and independent variables used in empirical research on effort estimation. Our study covering 820 Primary Studies through 14 SLRs, shows that Software Effort Estimation studies focus more on statistical techniques and Machine Learning is taking precedence in comparison to the others; whereas Expert Judgement is preferred by the industry due to its intuitiveness. There is a need for models that are simple to understand and global, due to the distributed nature of software development. The studies are inconclusive about the accuracy benefits of using a within company dataset vs.external datasets. Machine learning techniques such FL and GA in combination with Analogy methods generate more accurate estimates. There is increasing consensus on the use of Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), Median Magnitude of Relative Error (MdMRE) and Prediction Pred (25%) as the accuracy metric. 78% of the Primary Studies reported accuracy using MMRE. The best MMRE reported is in the range of 7 to 75.

In this step, quantitative results about presence and evolution are obtained. The second step is based on Grounded Theory (GT) techniques which are applied in order to obtain the description of programming teaching issues from expressions embedded in texts selected from specialized literature. From the comparison between descriptions, qualitative results about problematic evolution are obtained. Completeness is analyzed by applying the didactic triangle to the newest snapshot. © 2017 IEEE.","didactic triangle; problem characterization; programming teaching issues; Systematic Literature Research","Computers; didactic triangle; Grounded theory; Issues and challenges; Literature researches; Problem characterization; Programming teaching; Quantitative result; Systematic literature review (SLR); Computer science","Piccin, A.M.; Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones, Científicas y Técnicas (Centro Redes.), Universidad de BelgranoArgentina; email: ana.piccin@comunidad.ub.edu.ar","Santos R.Monteverde H.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538630570,,,"Spanish","Lat.

While the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a well-established methodology, it is rarely used in the field of engineering education. Though the use of the term ""systematic"" suggests a clear-cut process and there are resources available to describe the major steps of the method, the initial steps of a SLR are inherently messy-i.e., they heavily rely on the researcher's judgement and decision-making. Unfortunately, the messiness embedded in these steps is rarely discussed or described in existing resources. In this study, we reflect on the ""messiness"" of initiating a SLR on broadening participation in engineering and computer science. Informed by two existing approaches to reflection, we used the STAARA (Situation-Task-Affect-Action-Result-Aftermath) framework to reflect on the ways in which we resolved important decisions associated with one overarching situation and several corresponding tasks, affects, actions; the aftermath is also discussed. This paper includes insights from our experience that can help other researchers navigate the initial steps of a SLR. © 2017 IEEE.","Broadening participation; Reflection; Research methods; Systematic review","Decision making; Reflection; Broadening participation; Clear cuts; Engineering and computer science; Practical solutions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Engineering education",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781509059195,PFECD,,"English","Proc.

Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and Embase for full-text articles published between January 1, 2003 and March 18, 2017. Eligible studies compared at least two of the following in a real-world setting: warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban. A Bayesian NMA was conducted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for major bleeding using a random-effects model. Results: Eleven studies were included in the NMA. Nine studies included DOACs vs Warfarin comparisons, and four studies included DOACs vs DOACs comparisons (two studies included both comparisons). Median follow-up duration ranged from 2.6–31.2 months. No evidence was identified for edoxaban. Apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding compared to other oral anticoagulants (warfarin HR=0.58; 95% credible interval [CrI]=0.48–0.69; dabigatran¼0.73; 0.61–0.87; rivaroxaban=0.55; 0.46–0.66). Dabigatran was associated with a significantly lower risk than warfarin (0.79; 0.71–0.88) and rivaroxaban (0.76; 0.67–0.85), and rivaroxaban was not statistically different from warfarin (1.05; 0.91–1.19). Sensitivity analyses with standard dose and sponsorship showed consistent results. Conclusion: DOACs were associated with lower or similar risk of major bleeding compared with warfarin in NVAF patients. Apixaban was associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding than other DOACs. Dabigatran was associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeding compared to rivaroxaban and warfarin. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs); Major bleeding; Network metaanalysis (NMA); Non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF); Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs); Systematic review; Warfarin","apixaban; dabigatran; edoxaban; rivaroxaban; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; anemia; anticoagulant therapy; atrial fibrillation; Bayes theorem; bleeding; brain hemorrhage; CHADS2 score; comparative study; hematothorax; hematuria; human; intraocular hemorrhage; meta analysis; Review; risk factor; systematic review; thromboembolism; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; chemically induced; network meta-analysis; proportional hazards model; Anticoagulants; Atrial Fibrillation; Bayes Theorem; Hemorrhage; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Proportional Hazards Models","Ashaye, A.; Evidera Inc., 500 Totten Pond Road, Fifth Floor, United States; email: ajibade.ashaye@evidera.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",03007995,,CMROC,"29188721","English","Curr.

To date most SLRs have been conducted using a search strategy involving several digital libraries. However, significant issues have been reported for digital libraries and applying such search strategy requires substantial effort. On the other hand, snowballing has recently arisen as a potentially more efficient alternative or complementary solution. Nevertheless, it requires a relevant seed set of papers. [Aims] This paper proposes and evaluates a hybrid search strategy combining searching in a specific digital library (Scopus) with backward and forward snowballing. [Method] The proposed hybrid strategy was applied to two previously published SLRs that adopted database searches. We investigate whether it is able to retrieve the same included papers with lower effort in terms of the number of analysed papers. The two selected SLRs relate respectively to elicitation techniques (not confined to Software Engineering (SE)) and to a specific SE topic on cost estimation. [Results] Our results provide preliminary support for the proposed hybrid search strategy as being suitable for SLRs investigating a specific research topic within the SE domain. Furthermore, it helps overcoming existing issues with using digital libraries in SE. [Conclusions] The hybrid search strategy provides competitive results, similar to using several digital libraries. However, further investigation is needed to evaluate the hybrid search strategy. © 2017 IEEE.","hybrid strategy; search strategy; snowballing; systematic review","Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Search engines; Software engineering; Database searches; Elicitation techniques; Hybrid search strategies; Hybrid strategies; Search strategies; snowballing; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Digital libraries",,,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,9781509040391,,,"English","Int.

Multiple scheduling algorithms have been proposed to ensure that short interactive jobs, large batch jobs, and guaranteed-capacity production jobs running on these frameworks can deliver results quickly while maintaining a high throughput. However, only a few works have examined the effectiveness of these algorithms. Objective: The Evidence-based Software Engineering (EBSE) paradigm and its core tool, i.e., the Systematic Literature Review (SLR), have been introduced to the Software Engineering community in 2004 to help researchers systematically and objectively gather and aggregate research evidences about different topics. In this paper, we conduct a SLR of task scheduling algorithms that have been proposed for big data platforms. Method: We analyse the design decisions of different scheduling models proposed in the literature for Hadoop, Spark, Storm, and Mesos over the period between 2005 and 2016. We provide a research taxonomy for succinct classification of these scheduling models. We also compare the algorithms in terms of performance, resources utilization, and failure recovery mechanisms. Results: Our searches identifies 586 studies from journals, conferences and workshops having the highest quality in this field. This SLR reports about different types of scheduling models (dynamic, constrained, and adaptive) and the main motivations behind them (including data locality, workload balancing, resources utilization, and energy efficiency).

To address this limitation, a systematic review of literature focused on the ability of SM to better recognize illicit drug use trends was addressed. Methods A search was conducted in databases: PubMed, CINAHL via Ebsco, PsychINFO via Ebsco, Medline via Ebsco, ERIC, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, ABI/INFORM Complete and Communication and Mass Media Complete. Included studies were original research published in peer-reviewed journals between January 2005 and June 2015 that primarily focused on collecting data from SM platforms to track trends in illicit drug use. Excluded were studies focused on purchasing prescription drugs from illicit online pharmacies. Results Selected studies used a range of SM tools/applications, including message boards, Twitter and blog/forums/platform discussions. Limitations included relevance, a lack of standardized surveillance systems and a lack of efficient algorithms to isolate relevant items. Conclusion Illicit drug use is a worldwide problem, and the rise of global social networking sites has led to the evolution of a readily accessible surveillance tool. Systematic approaches need to be developed to efficiently extract and analyze illicit drug content from social networks to supplement effective prevention programs. © The Author 2017.","illicit drug prevention; Social media surveillance; Systematic review","peptide fragment; PR1P peptide; prescription drug; street drug; adolescent; adult; drug dependence; drug utilization; female; health survey; human; male; procedures; social media; social network; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Drug Utilization; Female; Humans; Male; Peptide Fragments; Population Surveillance; Prescription Drugs; Social Media; Social Networking; Street Drugs; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult","Kazemi, D.M.; School of Nursing, College of Health and Human Services, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, 9201 University City Blvd., CHHS 444C, United States; email: dkazemi@uncc.edu",,"Oxford University Press",17413842,,JPHOC,"28334848","English","J.

Given the changing disease landscape, this systematic literature review (SLR) aims to assess the impact of endocrine therapies (ET), including ET monotherapy (ET mono) and ET combined with targeted therapy (ET + TT), on QoL of women with HR+/HER2− ABC. Methods: A SLR was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) meeting the following criteria: (1) included ET mono or ET + TT, (2) reported QoL outcomes, (3) focused on women with HR+/HER2− ABC, and (4) published after 2007 (when standardized HER2 testing became available). The databases searched included MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and key conference proceedings from 2013 to 2016. QoL outcomes for ET mono, ET + TT, and comparisons between the two were summarized from the identified trials. Results: A total of 11 studies (representing 6 RCTs) were identified. The study populations included first-line (5 studies) and ET-failure settings (6 studies). Across settings, global health status (GHS) maintained or deteriorated slightly on these treatments during the trial period. Time to deterioration (TTD) in QoL measured by GHS was analyzed in 6 studies and 4 RCTs. In the first-line setting, reported median TTD in GHS was similar between ET mono and ET + TT (7.2–13.8 months in ET mono; 11.1 months in ET + TT). In the ET-failure setting, ET + TT showed significantly longer TTD vs. ET mono in GHS (median 5.6–8.4 months in ET mono and 8.3–11.7 months in ET + TT) and some additional domains. Conclusions: ET + TT users experienced similar QoL in the first-line and ET-failure setting relative to patients on ET mono. Moreover, ET + TT users experienced better QoL outcomes in some domains in the ET-failure setting relative to ET mono users.

The role of customer has dramatically changed with the rapid growth of s-commerce. Customer engagement behavior in the s-commerce context has become a key competitive advantage for companies that aim to build a customer-centric business and utilize the power of social media. Numerous studies have conducted to understand the customer behavior to engage in s-commerce, but little effort have been made to incorporate the previous studies to provide theoretical foundation of customer engagement in s-commerce context. The aim of this study is to identify the well utilized theories and factors that influence customer engagement behavior in s-commerce. The study used a systematic Literature Review (SLR) as a method to identify and analyze the theories and factors related to customer engagement. The results shows that the theories which constitute the foundation of customer engagement studies can be classified into: social related theories, technological related theories, behavioral theories and motivational theories, and most of the well utilized factors are tapped under theses classifications.

Despite this, progress in attaining MDG 5 is not remarkable in LMICs. Only 52% of pregnant women in LMICs obtain WHO recommended minimum of four antenatal consultations and the coverage of postnatal care is relatively poor. In recent years, the increased cellphone penetration has brought the potential for mHealth to improve preventive maternal healthcare services. The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of mHealth solutions on a range of maternal health outcomes by categorizing the interventions according to the types of mHealth applications. Methods: Three international online electronic databases were searched between January 1, 2000 and January 25, 2016 to identify studies exploring the role of mHealth solutions in improving preventive maternal healthcare services. Of 1262 titles screened after duplication, 69 potentially relevant abstracts were obtained. Out of 69 abstracts, 42 abstracts were shortlisted. Full text of 42 articles was reviewed using data extraction sheet. A total of 14 full text studies were included in the final analysis. Results: The 14 final studies were categorized in to five mHealth applications defined in the conceptual framework. Based on our analysis, the most reported use of mHealth was for client education and behavior change communication, such as SMS and voice reminders [n = 9, 65%]. The categorization provided the understanding that much work have been done on client education and behavior change communication. Most of the studies showed that mHealth interventions have proven to be effective to improve antenatal care and postnatal care services, especially those that are aimed at changing behavior of pregnant women and women in postnatal period. However, little evidence exists on other type of mHealth applications. Conclusion: This review suggests that mHealth solutions targeted at pregnant women and women in postnatal period can improve preventive maternal healthcare services. However, there is a need to conduct more controlled-trials and quasi-experimental studies to strengthen the literature in this research area.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Embase using Ovid with a predefined search strategy through 19 January 2016. All publicly available clinical reports on the use of delayed-release (DR) cysteamine bitartrate (Procysbi1) or immediate-release (IR) cysteamine bitartrate (Cystagon2) in patients with cystinosis were included. Results: We identified a total of 103 publications and 10 trial records. Of these, 9 studies describe DR cysteamine bitartrate (n = 267 patients), 42 describe IR cysteamine bitartrate (n = 1,427 patients) and in 53 studies the exact preparation was not specified (n = 906 patients). The vast majority of the studies used a non-randomized study design, with randomized clinical trials (RCTs) being scarce (1 study comparing DR and IR formulation) and case reports (n = 49) being the most common study design representing 47% of the total. Conclusion: A substantial evidence base for cysteamine bitartrate in the treatment of nephropathic cystinosis was identified. However, the majority of the evidence was of relatively low quality, with evidence levels of 3 or 4. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","delayed-release cysteamine bitartrate; immediate-release cysteamine bitartrate; Nephropathic cystinosis","mercaptamine; mercaptamine; area under the curve; Article; comparative study; cost effectiveness analysis; cystinosis; drug release; drug synthesis; drug tolerability; human; kidney disease; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; cystinosis; Fanconi renotubular syndrome; Cysteamine; Cystinosis; Fanconi Syndrome; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Medic, G.; Horizon Pharma Europe BV, Graadt van Roggeweg 340, Building D, 5th Floor, Netherlands; email: gmedic@horizonpharma.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd",03007995,,CMROC,"28692321","English","Curr.

These barriers increase the cost of conducting SLRs. Objective For many of these barriers, appropriate tool support could reduce their impact. In this paper, we use interactions with the SLR community in SE to identify and prioritize a set of requirements for SLR tooling infrastructure. Method This paper analyzes and combines the results from three studies on SLR process barriers and SLR tool requirements to produce a prioritized list of functional requirements for SLR tool support. Using this list of requirements, we perform a feature analysis of the current SLR support tools to identify requirements that are supported as well as identify the need for additional tooling infrastructure. Results The analysis resulted in a list 112 detailed requirements (consolidated into a set of composite requirements) that SE community desires in SLR support tools. The requirements span all the phases of the SLR process. The results show that, while recent tools cover more of the requirements, there are a number of high-priority requirements that are not yet fully covered by any of the existing tools. Conclusion The existing set of SLR tools do not cover all the requirements posed by the community. The list of requirements in this paper is useful for tool developers and researchers wishing to provide support to the SLR community with SE. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Empirical software engineering; Systematic literature review; Tooling infrastructure","Information systems; Empirical Software Engineering; Feature analysis; Functional requirement; Support tool; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Tool requirements; Tooling infrastructure; Software engineering","Carver, J.C.; The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, United States; email: carver@cs.ua.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021798809

To date, a number of models that support task allocation have been proposed, including cost models and risk-based multi-criteria optimization models. Objective The objective of this paper is to identify the factors that influence task allocation in the GSD project management context. Method First, we implemented a formal Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach and identified a set of factors that influence task allocation in GSD projects. Second, a questionnaire survey was developed based on the SLR, and we collected feedback from 62 industry practitioners. Results The findings of this combined SLR and questionnaire survey indicate that site technical expertise, time zone difference, resource cost, task dependency, task size and vendor reliability are the key criteria for the distribution of work units in a GSD project. The results of the t-test show that there is no significant difference between the findings of the SLR and questionnaire survey. However, the industry study data indicates that resource cost and task dependency are more important to a centralized GSD project structure while task size is a key factor in a decentralized GSD project structure. Conclusion GSD organizations should try to consider the identified task allocation factors when managing their global software development activities to better understand, plan and manage work distribution decisions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Empirical study; Global Software Development; Systematic Literature Review; Task Allocation","Costs; Multiobjective optimization; Optimization; Project management; Surveys; Empirical studies; Global software development; Multicriteria optimization; Questionnaire surveys; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Task allocation; Technical expertise; Software design","Mahmood, S.; Information and Computer Science Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and MineralsSaudi Arabia; email: smahmood@kfupm.edu.sa",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021905032

Enterprise Architecture Implementation Methodology (EAIM) prepares a set of methods and practices for developing, managing, and maintaining an EA implementation project. There is ineffectiveness in existing EAIMs due to complexities emerging from EAIM practices, models, factors, and strategy. Consequently, EA projects may encounter lack of support in the following areas: requirements analysis, governance and evaluation, guideline for implementation, and continual improvement of EA implementation. The aim of this research is to develop an effective EAIM to support EA implementation. To fulfill this objective, the first step is to identify effective EA implementation practices and the factors that impact the effectiveness of EAIM. In this regard, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted in order to identify the effective practices and factors of EAIM. Secondly, the proposed EAIM is developed based on the foundations and information extracted from the SLR and semi-structured interviews with EA practitioners. Finally, the proposed EAIM is evaluated by means of case study as the research methodology. The target audience for this research is twofold: (1) researchers who would extend the effective EA implementation and continue this research topic with further analysis and exploration; (2) practitioners who would like to employ an effective and lightweight EAIM for an EA project. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Enterprise Architecture; Implementation Methodology; Information systems; Integration; Strategy",,"Shamshirband, S.; Department for Management of Science and Technology Development, Ton Duc Thang UniversityViet Nam; email: shahaboddin.shamshirband@tdt.edu.vn",,"Springer Verlag",16179846,,,,"English","Inf.

Our aim was to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) and to develop consensus definitions of key pathologies, anatomical locations for assessment, a set of MRI sequences and imaging planes for the different body regions, and a preliminary scoring system for WB-MRI in inflammatory arthritis. Methods: An SLR was initially performed, searching for WB-MRI studies in arthritis, osteoarthritis, spondyloarthritis, or enthesitis. These results were presented to a meeting of the MRI in Arthritis Working Group together with an MR image review. Following this, preliminary standards for WB-MRI in inflammatory arthritides were developed with further iteration at the Working Group meetings at the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) 2016. Results: The SLR identified 10 relevant original articles (7 cross-sectional and 3 longitudinal, mostly focusing on synovitis and/or enthesitis in spondyloarthritis, 4 with reproducibility data). The Working Group decided on inflammation in peripheral joints and entheses as primary focus areas, and then developed consensus MRI definitions for these pathologies, selected anatomical locations for assessment, agreed on a core set of MRI sequences and imaging planes for the different regions, and proposed a preliminary scoring system. It was decided to test and further develop the system by iterative multireader exercises. Conclusion: These first steps in developing an OMERACT WB-MRI scoring system for use in inflammatory arthritides offer a framework for further testing and refinement.

Methods Databases including PubMed, The Cochrane Library, EMbase, CBM were searched from inception to August 2016, to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about short message service (SMS) for smoking cessation. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Then meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12.0 software. Results A total of 14 RCTs involving 15 543 participants were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that, compared with the control group, no significant difference was found in self-reported three months continuous abstinence (RR=0.830, 95%CI 0.679 to 1.014, P=0.069), 30 day point quit rate (RR=0.878, 95%CI 0.687 to 1.122, P=0.076). However, there were significant differences in the self-reported 7-day point abstinence (RR=1.149, 95%CI 1.014 to 1.303, P=0.03), the CO biochemical verification abstinence (RR=0.571, 95%CI 0.357 to 0.914, P=0.020), and the average number of cigarettes smoked per day (SMD=–0.25, 95%CI –0.37 to –0.12, P<0.001). Conclusion The available evidence indicates that short message intervention has a better effect on short-term smoking cessation. Therefore, more long-term studies are needed to determine the association between SMS and quit smoking behavior. © 2017, West China University of Medical Science.

In this regard, data aggregation as an efficient method is used to decrease the number of transmissions among objects. The loss of data redundancy leads to lengthen the network lifetime and decrease the energy consumption. Although the data aggregation has a vital role in the IoT, there is not any systematic and comprehensive study about analyzing its important mechanisms. Therefore, this paper aims to study and review the present data aggregation mechanisms in the IoT systematically.

Mobile technologies offer the potential to efficiently deliver interventions to facilitate HIV self-management. The last comprehensive review of such mHealth interventions was conducted in 2011. Given the rapidly evolving field, a need was identified for an updated review of the literature. Objective: The study aimed to describe and evaluate current evidence-based mHealth interventions to support self-management in HIV. Method: Eight online databases (Medline, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Global Health CAB, IEEE explore, Web of Science) were systematically searched for papers describing and evaluating mHealth HIV self-management interventions. Reference lists of relevant papers were also searched. Data on intervention content and evaluation methodology were extracted and appraised by two researchers. Results: 41 papers were identified evaluating 28 interventions. The majority of these interventions (n=20, 71%) had a single focus of either improving adherence (n=16), increasing engagement in care (n=3) or supporting smoking cessation (n=1), while just 8 (29%) were more complex self-management interventions, targeting a range of health-related behaviours. Interventions were predominantly delivered through SMS messaging. They significantly impacted on a range of outcomes including adherence, viral load, mental health and social support. Conclusion: Since the last major review of mHealth interventions in HIV, there has been a shift from exploratory acceptability/feasibility studies to impact evaluations. While overall the interventions impacted on a range of outcomes, they were generally limited in scope, failing to encompass many functions identified as desirable by people living with HIV. Participant incentives may limit the generalizability of findings. © 2017 Cooper et al.","HIV treatment; Information technology; mHealth; Mobile phone; Self-management","bibliographic database; clinical practice; cost effectiveness analysis; disease exacerbation; feasibility study; health behavior; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; mental health; outcome assessment; patient compliance; preventive health service; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; self care; smoking cessation; social acceptance; social support; systematic review; virus load","Whetham, J.; The Lawson Unit, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, Eastern Road, United Kingdom; email: jennifer.whetham@bsuh.nhs.uk",,"Bentham Science Publishers B.V.",18746136,,,,"English","Open AIDS J.",Review,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043576906

In fact, ITS makes inferences about a student's proficiency level in order to dynamically adapt the learning content or the tutoring style. Around the same time, emotions, whether positive or negative, affect the learning process. Accordingly, the regulation of learners' negative emotional state, is an imperious factor in learning, in order to optimize learners' performances and to improve learning productivity during an ITS episode. Firstly, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on strategies for regulating the emotional state of learners in the point of view of (a) emotion recognition, (b) emotion modelling, (c) emotion recognition theories, and (d) emotion recognition approaches and methods. Secondly, the paper proposes a new intelligent method, and presents its architecture as a Fuzzy Emotional Regulation for ITS distributed under the Multiagent Approach.

However, some of these methods are narrow in scope, only considering few risks, and are too complex to be used in practice whereas others provide many rules and guidelines which are often implicit. Moreover, the knowledge related to risks in DSD is scattered over different publications which make it difficult to find relevant information to be used in practice. This research aims to develop an automated decision support system to aid practitioners in assessing risks and deciding on suitable control strategies. In order to construct the knowledge base for the proposed decision support system, a systematic literature review (SLR) is conducted. Results of SLR are used to identify required questions, options and set of rules to implement our decision support system (DSS). In total 80 studies were identified from which 49 aspects, 53 questions, and a set of rules are extracted. DSS is evaluated through multiple case studies. The results indicate that the developed DSS supports decision-making process in risk assessment and selection of control strategy. © 2013 IEEE.","decision support system; Distributed software development; risk analysis","Artificial intelligence; Bibliographies; Computer software; Decision making; Industry; Knowledge based systems; Planning; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risks; Software design; Control strategies; Decision making process; Decision support system (dss); Distributed software development; Guidelines; Multiple-case study; Risk assessment and managements; Systematic literature review (SLR); Decision support systems","Ahmad, N.; Department of Computer Science, COMSATS Institute of Information TechnologyPakistan; email: naveedahmad@comsats.edu.pk",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030782327

This is due to the ontological and epistemological idiosyncrasies of research in supply chain management, which need to be accounted for when retrieving, selecting, and synthesizing studies in an SLR. Therefore, we propose a new paradigm for SLRs in the supply chain domain that is based on both best practice and the unique attributes of doing supply chain management research. This approach involves exploring existing studies with attention to theoretical boundaries, units of analysis, sources of data, study contexts, and definitions and the operationalization of constructs, as well as research methods, with the goal of refining or revising existing theory. This new paradigm will push supply chain management research to the frontier of current methodological standards and build a foundation for improving the contribution of future SLRs in the supply chain and adjacent management disciplines. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bias; guidelines; literature review; methodology; paradigm",,,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",15232409,,,,"English","J.

However, few developers have a broad understanding of how software tools may be used in publication or consumption of Linked Data. The goal of this work is to investigate the use of software tools in Linked Data publication and consumption processes. More specifically, understanding how these software tools are related to process of publication or consumption of LD. In order to meet their goal, the authors conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the studies on the use of software tools in these processes. The SLR gathered 6473 studies, of which only 80 studies remained for final analysis (1.25% of the original sample). The highlights of the study are: (1) initial steps of the publication process are fairly supported by the software tools; (2) Non-RDF serialization is fairly supported in publication and consumptions process by the software tools; and (3) there are non-supported steps in consumption and publication processes by the tools.

Methods We electronically searched databases including PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, CNKI and CBM from inception to August 2016, to collect randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about short message intervention in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Then metaanalysis was performed using Stata 12.0 software. Results A total of 17 RCTs involving 2 879 patients were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that, on the basis of basic treatment, the use of text messages could lower the levels of HbA1c (SMD3 months=−0.50, 95%CI −0.67 to −0.34, P&lt;0.001; SMD6 months=−0.33, 95%CI −0.59 to −0.07, P=0.012), FBG (SMD3 months=−0.28, 95%CI −0.45 to −0.11, P=0.001; SMD9 months=−0.99, 95%CI −1.44 to −0.54, P&lt;0.001), PBG (SMD3 months=−0.99, 95%CI −1.54 to −0.44, P&lt;0.001; SMD6 months=−0.81, 95%CI −1.25 to −0.36, P&lt;0.001; SMD9 months=−0.78, 95%CI −1.23 to −0.34, P=0.001). Conclusion The current evidence shows that the use of SMS can improve glycosylated hemoglobin and blood glucose levels on type 2 diabetes patients. Due to limited quality and quantity of the included studies, the above conclusions are needed to be verified by more high quality studies. © 2017, West China University of Medical Science.

Several researchers have reported their experiences in applying SLRs in Software Engineering (SE) however, there is still a lack of studies discussing the iterative nature of the protocol definition, especially how it should be perceived by researchers conducting SLRs. Objective: The main goal of this study is to perform a survey aiming to identify: (i) the perception of SE researchers related to protocol definition; (ii) the activities of the review process that typically lead to protocol refinements; and (iii) which protocol items are refined in those activities. Method: A survey was performed with 53 SE researchers. Results: Our results show that: (i) protocol definition and pilot test are the two activities that most lead to further protocol refinements; (ii) data extraction form is the most modified item. Besides that, this study confirmed the iterative nature of the protocol definition.

In recent years, stem cells have been the subject of increasing scientific interest because of their utility in numerous biomedical and toxicology applications. this study aimed to assess applications of cancer stem cells in toxicological studies. eviDence acQUiSition: a search of the literature was performed through PubMed, cochrane library, Medline, and Science citation index expanded databases for articles published in english language. We performed a formal systematic review using summary measures from these studies. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: In total, 7 published studies were included in the final analysis. any chemical, especially at noncytotoxic concentrations, could induce intracellular signaling, which, in turn, could alter the fate of stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: The studies seem to suggest that stem cell technology represents a contribution of great impact to the field of chemical compound toxicology.

These enzymes play a key role in cellulose degrading, such as alleviating product inhibition of cellulases. Consequently, they have been considered essential for the biofuel industry. However, the majority of the characterized β-glucosidases is inhibited by glucose. Hence, glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases have been targeted to improve the production of second-generation biofuels. In this paper, we proceeded a systematic literature review (SLR), collected protein structures and constructed a database of glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases, called betagdb. SLR was performed at PubMed, ScienceDirect and Scopus Library databases and conducted according to PRISMA framework. It was conducted in five steps: i) analysis of duplications, ii) title reading, iii) abstract reading, iv) diagonal reading, and v) full-text reading. The second, third, fourth, and fifth steps were performed independently by two researchers. Besides, we performed bioinformatics analysis on the collected data, such as structural and multiple alignments to detect the most conserved residues in the catalytic pocket, and molecular docking to characterize essential residues for substrate recognizing, glucose tolerance, and the β-glucosidase activity. We selected 27 papers, 23 sequences, and 5 PDB files of glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases. We characterized 11 highly conserved residues: H121, W122, N166, E167, N297, Y299, E355, W402, E409, W410, and F418. The presence of these residues may be essential for β-glucosidases. We also discussed the importance of residues W169, C170, L174, H181, and T226. Furthermore, we proposed that the number of contacts for each residue in the catalytic pocket might be a metric that could be used to suggest mutations. We believe that the herein propositions, together with the sequence and structural data collection, might be helpful for effective engineering of β-glucosidases for biofuel production and may help to shed some light on the degradation of cellulosic biomass. © 2017 The Authors.","Biofuel; Bioinformatics; Glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases; Systematic literature review",,"Mariano, D.C.B.; Laboratório de Bioinformática e Sistemas, Departamento de Ciência da Computação, Universidade Federal de Minas GeraisBrazil; email: diegomariano@ufmg.br",,"Fundacao de Pesquisas Cientificas de Ribeirao Preto",16765680,,,,"English","Genet.

The application of right data analysis technique during the SLR evaluation stage would give an insight to the researcher in achieving the SLR objective. This paper presents how descriptive analysis and text analysis can be applied to achieve one of the common SLR objectives which is to study the progress of specific research domain. These techniques have been demonstrated to synthesis the progress of Master Data Management research domain. Using descriptive analysis technique, this study has identified a trend of related literary works distribution by years, sources, and publication types. Meanwhile, text analysis shows the common terms and interest topics in the Master Data Management research which are 1) master data, 2) data quality, 3) business intelligence, 4) business process, 5) data integration, 6) big data, 7) data governance, 8) information governance, 9) data management and 10) product data. It is hoped that other researchers would be able to replicate these analysis techniques in performing SLR for other research domains. © 2017 IEEE.","Descriptive Analysis; Master Data Management; Systematic Literature Review; Text Analysis","Big data; Data integration; Information analysis; Information systems; Management science; Metadata; Quality control; Analysis techniques; Data analysis techniques; Data governances; Descriptive analysis; Master data management; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Text analysis; Information management",,,"IEEE Computer Society",23248149,9781509030354,,,"English","Int.

Static analysis approaches have been proposed for different tasks, including for assessing the security of Android apps, detecting app clones, automating test cases generation, or for uncovering non-functional issues related to performance or energy. The literature thus has proposed a large body of works, each of which attempts to tackle one or more of the several challenges that program analyzers face when dealing with Android apps. Objective We aim to provide a clear view of the state-of-the-art works that statically analyze Android apps, from which we highlight the trends of static analysis approaches, pinpoint where the focus has been put, and enumerate the key aspects where future researches are still needed. Method We have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) which involves studying 124 research papers published in software engineering, programming languages and security venues in the last 5 years (January 2011–December 2015). This review is performed mainly in five dimensions: problems targeted by the approach, fundamental techniques used by authors, static analysis sensitivities considered, android characteristics taken into account and the scale of evaluation performed. Results Our in-depth examination has led to several key findings: 1) Static analysis is largely performed to uncover security and privacy issues; 2) The Soot framework and the Jimple intermediate representation are the most adopted basic support tool and format, respectively; 3) Taint analysis remains the most applied technique in research approaches; 4) Most approaches support several analysis sensitivities, but very few approaches consider path-sensitivity; 5) There is no single work that has been proposed to tackle all challenges of static analysis that are related to Android programming; and 6) Only a small portion of state-of-the-art works have made their artifacts publicly available. Conclusion The research community is still facing a number of challenges for building approaches that are aware altogether of implicit-Flows, dynamic code loading features, reflective calls, native code and multi-threading, in order to implement sound and highly precise static analyzers. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Android (operating system); Codes (symbols); Engineering research; Mobile security; Software engineering; Intermediate representations; Program properties; Program source codes; Research communities; Security and privacy issues; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Test cases generation; Static analysis","Li, L.; Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of LuxembourgLuxembourg; email: li.li@uni.lu",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017357042

There is uncertainty regarding the optimal format and the short- and long-term benefits of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) SM interventions in adults. Therefore, a high-quality overview of reviews was updated to examine their clinical effectiveness. Sixteen reviews were identified, interventions were broadly classified as education or action plans, complex interventions with an SM focus, pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), telehealth and outreach nursing. Systematic review and meta-analysis quality and the risk of bias of underlying primary studies were assessed. Strong evidence was found that PR is associated with significant improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Limited to moderate evidence for complex interventions (SM focus) with limited evidence for education, action plans, telehealth interventions and outreach nursing for HRQoL was found. There was strong evidence that education is associated with a significant reduction in COPD-related hospital admissions, moderate to strong evidence that telehealth interventions and moderate evidence that complex interventions (SM focus) are associated with reduced health care utilization. These findings from a large body of evidence suggesting that SM, through education or as a component of PR, confers significant health gains in people with COPD in terms of HRQoL. SM supported by telehealth confers significant reductions in healthcare utilization, including hospitalization and emergency department visits. © SAGE Publications Ltd unless otherwise noted.

This revolution also created challenges for vendor organizations. Vendors face challenges in integrating the components developed independently by GSD teams into a final working product. Objective: The objectives of the current study is to find out those critical barriers/challenges that hinder the integration process at any stage in the GSD environment for different types and size of projects. Methodology: For achieving the objectives we initially conducted a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR). We searched 6 digital libraries and also followed the snowballing technique. The data was extracted from a total of 88 finally selected papers. Findings of the SLR study were then empirically validated through a questionnaire survey in GSD industry. A total of 96 experts from 22 different countries participated in the survey. Results: We have found a total of 16 barriers/challenges among which ten barriers are ranked as critical barriers/challenges. Some of the top ranked barriers are “lack of communication,” “lack of proper documentation,” “lack of compatibility,” and “architecture mismatch.” The findings of our industrial survey are mostly coherent with the SLR findings. However, there is a difference in ranks of the various barriers/challenges across the 2 data sets (SLR and industrial survey). The identified challenges need to be properly addressed by software vendors to reduce the complexity of the integration process in GSD projects. Conclusion: We found that the severity of these barriers increases in large size projects. On the other hand, bespoke products are more affected by “lack of communication,” while off-the-shelf–based projects face integration problems due to “lack of compatibility,” “architecture mismatch,” and “wrong off the shelf product selection and customization”.

Our aim was to review the literature and web-based content on SM that is used by Colorectal Cancer (CRC) patients, as well as surgeons’ interaction with SM. Method Studies published between 2006 and 2016 were assessed. We also assessed the impact of several hashtags on Twitter with a freeware (Symplur). Results Nine studies were included assessing Twitter (78%), Forums/Cancer-survivor networks (33%), and Facebook (22%). Aims included use of SM by CRC patients (67%), cancer-specific usage of SM with different types of cancer (44%), content credibility (33%), and influence in CRC awareness (33%). Prevention was the most common information that CRC patients looked for, followed by treatment side-effects. Only 2% of CRC SM users are doctors. SM use by colorectal consultants was suboptimal. Only 38% of surgeons had a LinkedIn account (most with less than 50 connections), and 3% used Twitter. A steep increase of tweets was observed for searched Hashtags over time, which was more marked for #ColonCancer (+67%vs+38%, #Coloncancer vs #RectalCancer). Participants engaged with colon cancer increased by 85%, whereas rectal cancer ones increased by 29%. The hashtag ‘#RectalCancer’ was mostly tweeted by colorectal surgeons. The official twitter account of American Society of Colorectal Surgeons (@fascrs_updates) was the most active account. Conclusion CRC patients and relatives are increasingly engaging with SM. CRC surgeons’ participation is poor, but we confirm a trend toward a greater involvement. Most SM lack of authoritative validation and the quality of shared content still is largely anecdotic and not scientifically evidenced-based.

However, many people fail to meet PA recommendations. Despite a plethora of studies, the evidence regarding the environmental (physical) determinants of physical activity remains inconclusive. Objective: To identify the physical environmental determinants that influence PA across the life course. Methods: An online systematic literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Scopus and SPORTDiscus. The search was limited to studies published in English (January 2004 to April 2016). Only systematic literature reviews (SLRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) of observational studies, that investigated the association between physical determinants and physical activity outcomes, were eligible for inclusion. The extracted data were assessed on the importance of determinants, strength of evidence and methodological quality. Results: The literature search identified 28 SLRs and 3 MAs on 67 physical environmental characteristics potentially related to physical activity that were eligible for inclusion. Among preschool children, a positive association was reported between availability of backyard space and outdoor toys/equipment in the home and overall physical activity. The availability of physical activity programs and equipment within schools, and neighbourhood features such as pedestrian and cyclist safety structure were positively associated with physical activity in children and adolescents. Negative street characteristics, for example, lack of sidewalks and streetlights, were negatively associated with physical activity in adults. Inconsistent associations were reported for the majority of reviewed determinants in adults. Conclusion: This umbrella SLR provided a comprehensive overview of the physical environment determinants of physical activity across the life course and has highlighted, particularly amongst youth, a number of key determinants that may be associated with overall physical activity. Given the limited evidence drawn mostly from cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies are needed to further explore these associations.

Mutation testing is also used as a way to drive the test data development process. Traditionally, faults were inserted one by one into a software system, but more recently there has been an upsurge of interest by the area of higher-order mutation, in which multiple faults are inserted into the system at once. Originally, this was thought to be too expensive, as there was already a concern that the size of the pool of mutants for traditional mutation was already too large to handle. However, following a seminal publication in 2008, it was realized that the space of higher-order mutants (HOMs) could be searched for useful mutants that drive testing harder, and to reduce the overall test effort, by clever combination of first-order mutants. As a result, many authors examined the way in which HOM testing could find subtle hard to kill faults, capture partial fault masking, reduce equivalent mutants problem, reduce test effort while increasing effectiveness, and capture more realistic faults than those captured by simple insertion of first-order mutants. Because of the upsurge of interest in the previous issues, this paper presents the first Systematic Literature Review research specifically targeted at a higher-order mutation. This Systematic Literature Review analyzes the results of more than one hundred sixty research articles in this area. The current paper presents qualitative results and bibliometric analysis for the surveyed articles. In addition, it augments these results with scientific findings and quantitative results from the primary literature. As a result of this work, this SLR presents an outline for many future work. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","First-order mutants; Higher-order mutants; Higher-order mutation testing; Mutation testing","Ability testing; Computer software; Digital storage; Bibliometric analysis; Equivalent Mutants; First order; Higher-order; Mutation testing; Quantitative result; Scientific findings; Systematic literature review; Software testing","Ghiduk, A.S.; College of Computers and IT, Taif UniversitySaudi Arabia; email: asaghiduk@tu.edu.sa",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",15740137,,,,"English","Comput.

Due to the abundance of devices and ease of access they subsequently allow, the utility of mobile health (mHealth) has never been more endemic. A substantial amount of interactive and psychoeducational apps are readily available to download concerning a wide range of health issues. mHealth has the potential to reduce waiting times for appointments; eradicate the need to meet in person with a clinician, successively diminishing the workload of mental health professionals; be more cost effective to practices; and encourage self-care tactics. Previous research has given valid evidence with empirical studies proving the effectiveness of physical and mental health interventions using mobile apps. Alongside apps, there is evidence to show that receiving short message service (SMS) messages, which entail psychoeducation, medication reminders, and links to useful informative Web pages can also be advantageous to a patient's mental and physical well-being. Available mHealth apps and SMS services and their ever improving quality necessitates a systematic review in the area in reference to reduction of symptomology, adherence to intervention, and usability. Objective: The aim of this review was to study the efficacy, usability, and feasibility of mobile apps and SMS messages as mHealth interventions for self-guided care. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in JMIR, PubMed, PsychINFO, PsychARTICLES, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and SAGE. The search spanned from January 2008 to January 2017. The primary outcome measures consisted of weight management, (pregnancy) smoking cessation, medication adherence, depression, anxiety and stress. Where possible, adherence, feasibility, and usability outcomes of the apps or SMS services were evaluated. Between-group and within-group effect sizes (Cohen d) for the mHealth intervention method group were determined. Results: A total of 27 studies, inclusive of 4658 participants were reviewed. The papers included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n=19), within-group studies (n=7), and 1 within-group study with qualitative aspect. Studies show improvement in physical health and significant reductions of anxiety, stress, and depression. Within-group and between-group effect sizes ranged from 0.05-3.37 (immediately posttest), 0.05-3.25 (1-month follow-up), 0.08-3.08 (2-month follow-up), 0.00-3.10 (3-month follow-up), and 0.02-0.27 (6-month follow-up). Usability and feasibility of mHealth interventions, where reported, also gave promising, significant results. Conclusions: The review shows the promising and emerging efficacy of using mobile apps and SMS text messaging as mHealth interventions. © Amy Leigh Rathbone, Julie Prescott.","Health; Intervention study; MHealth; Portable electronic applications; Review; Short message service; Smartphone; Systematic; Treatment efficacy","education; female; human; mental health; mobile application; mobile phone; procedures; telemedicine; text messaging; utilization; Cell Phone; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Mobile Applications; Telemedicine; Text Messaging","Rathbone, A.L.; School of Education and Psychology, University of Bolton, Deane Road, United Kingdom; email: alr3wss@bolton.ac.uk",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,"28838887","English","J.

The former requires medical prescription; the latter are available for SM of common minor or easily treated ailments. However, in the Eastern Mediterranean countries, theoretical prescription medicines can easily be purchased without a prescription, as self-medication (SM) resulting in potential misuse and unnecessary risk for patients. The magnitude of this activity is uncertain. The aim of this article, therefore, is to undertake a comprehensive review to identify the different types of medicines that can easily be purchased as SM in Middle East and recognized as misused. An extensive review of the published literature (1990–2015) was conducted using Pubmed, web of science, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases, for OTC medicine misuse in the Middle East. A total of 72 papers were identified. Medicines involved in misuse included: codeine containing products, topical anesthetics, topical corticosteroids, antimalarial, and antibiotics. Self-medication misuse of medicines seemed widespread. Individual treatment patterns were not clearly identified. Studies were not standardized, limiting the comparability between studies and the estimation of the scale of misuse. Pharmacists, friends, or parents were found to be the main sources of SMs. Knowledge and attitudes are an important contributing factor in the misuse of these medications. Strategies and interventions to limit misuse were rarely identified in literature. In conclusion, a massive problem involving a range of medicines was found in Middle East. Standardization of studies is a prerequisite to the understanding and prevention of misuse of self-medication. © 2017 The Authors.

Although psychological factors have been identified as an important category concerning PA behavior, knowledge on psychological determinants of PA is still inconclusive. Therefore, the aim of this umbrella systematic literature review (SLR) was to summarize and synthesize the scientific evidence on psychological determinants of PA behavior across the life course. A systematic online search was conducted on MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases. The search was limited to studies published in English from January 2004 to April 2016. SLRs and meta-analyses (MAs) of observational studies investigating the association of psychological variables and PA were considered eligible. Extracted data were evaluated based on importance of determinants, strength of evidence, and methodological quality. The full protocol is available from PROSPERO (Record ID: CRD42015010616). Twenty reviews (14 SLRs and 6 MAs), mostly of moderate methodological quality, were found eligible. Convincing evidence was found for self-efficacy (positive association with PA) in children and adolescents, and stress (negative association with PA) regardless of age. Most of the evidence revealing an association between psychological determinants and PA is probable and limited, mainly due to differences in the definition of PA and of psychological determinants across reviews. Thus, scholars are urged to reach a consensus on clear definitions of relevant psychological determinants of PA, subsuming cultural biases and allowing the possibility to obtain clear interpretations and generalizability of findings. Finally, most psychological determinants should be considered within a larger framework of other multi-level determinants that may interact or mediate some of the effects. © 2017 Ma et al.

However, research in this field varies considerably in its assumptions and methods and contains contradictory findings. Additionally, there is no consistent definition of AL. This situation makes it difficult for the university administration to see the overall picture or to evaluate which results are most reliable and should be used as the basis for practice and policy decisions. A systematic literature review (SLR) would address these problems by identifying, meticulously evaluating, and integrating findings of the relevant studies. To date, no SLR has been undertaken in the field of alumni loyalty. The purpose of this study is twofold. First, the paper conducts an SLR in this research area. Second, the study provides a more comprehensive definition of alumni loyalty. The research identified 102 relevant articles and classified them according to seven theoretical approaches: microeconomics, charitable giving, management, relationship marketing, educational science, services marketing, and the integrative approach, which combines the above disciplines. Having determined four primary aspects of AL (behavioral, attitudinal, material and nonmaterial), the paper derives four quadrants of AL definitions and assigns each publication to one or two of them. Following this step, the overall picture and definition of AL were derived. The findings can be used by academics as a framework to position new research activities appropriately and by practitioners as a roadmap to enhance AL rate. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.","Alumni loyalty (AL); customer loyalty; decision-maker; systematic literature review",,"Iskhakova, L.; Chair of Business Informatics, Faculty of Business and Economics, Technische Universität Dresden, 10 Helmholtzstraße, Germany; email: li.iskhakova@googlemail.com",,"Routledge",10495142,,,,"English","J.

In this paper, we summarize the existing condition of smart campus development in term of features, supported technologies, and applications were built using systematic literature review (SLR) as the standard methodology used to solve any problems by tracing the results of previous research. The problems declared in SLR are commonly called as research question (RQ). To achieve that goal, we define some RQs related to that scope and clarify each question by tracing previous research papers which are indexed in reputable journal databases such as IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Springerlink, and ScienceDirect. After synthesizing 29 articles, the results are: Contactless technology provides an easier way to enter data when accessing a particular room or equipment than using a keyboard; IoT supports an easier way to report real-time environment status; cloud computing is used to organize various information effectively and provide data services; iCampus becomes a popular smart campus model and if we map the applications that have been built into iCampus; there is no applications as part of iHealth domain. The main contribution of smart campus development based on previous research is to make easier in all campus aspect life. The contribution expected through this paper is to provide an overview for researchers who want to build applications in a campus as research challenge so that they can use appropriate technology and meet the characteristics of smart campus. © 2017 IEEE.","research challenge; SLR; smart campus; summary","Appropriate technologies; Contactless technology; Real-time environment; Research challenges; smart campus; summary; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538631003,,,"English","Int.

However, there are many challenges associated with GSD, particularly with regards to software process improvement (SPI). SPI can play a significant role in the successful execution of GSD projects. Objective The aim of the present study was to identify barriers that can negatively affect SPI initiatives in GSD organizations from both client and vendor perspectives. Method A systematic literature review (SLR) and survey questionnaire were used to identify and validate the barriers. Results Twenty-two barriers to successful SPI programs were identified. Results illustrate that the barriers identified using SLR and survey approaches have more similarities However, there were significant differences between the ranking of these barriers in the SLR and survey approaches, as indicated by the results of t-tests (for instance, t = 2.28, p = 0.011 < 0.05). Our findings demonstrate that there is a moderate positive correlation between the ranks obtained from the SLR and the empirical study (rs (22) = 0.567, p = 0.006). Conclusions The identified barriers can assist both client and vendor GSD organizations during initiation of an SPI program. Client-vendor classification was used to provide a broad picture of SPI programs, and their respective barriers. The top-ranked barriers can be used as a guide for GSD organizations prior to the initiation of an SPI program. We believe that the results of this study can be useful in tackling the problems associated with the implementation of SPI, which is vital to the success and progression of GSD organizations. © 2017","Barriers; Client; Global software development; Software process improvement; Systematic literature review; Vendor","Process engineering; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Barriers; Client; Global software development; Software Process Improvement; Systematic literature review; Vendor; Software design","Khan, A.A.; Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong KongHong Kong; email: aliakhan2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017125309

Results Out of 1082 articles, 19 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, with two additional studies identified that did not specify the patient age range and are therefore not included in the SLR. Overall, eight studies reported incidence with a range of 0-56 per 1000 person-years (PYs), with one outlying study reporting an incidence of 263 per 1000 PYs. Eleven studies reported prevalence with a range of 0-128 per 1000 people. Prevalence of DKA decreased with increasing age. Subgroup analyses were performed using data from no more than two studies per subgroup. There was a higher prevalence of DKA reported in women, non-whites and patients treated with insulin injections compared with men, whites and patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps, respectively. Conclusions To our knowledge, this is the first SLR on the epidemiology of DKA in T1D adults. Despite an increasing prevalence of T1D in recent years, DKA in adults has been poorly characterised. In an era when the benefit-risk profiles of new antidiabetic therapies are being evaluated, including the potential risk of DKA, there is a clear need to better elucidate the expected rate of DKA among T1D adults. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

We searched for articles relevant to pseudoexfoliation syndrome, pseudoexfoliation glaucoma and corneal endothelial cell counts using Pubmed, Google Scholar Database, Web of Science and cochrane Library databases published prior to September of 2016. We then screened the references of these retrieved papers and performed a Web of Science cited reference search. corneal characteristics analyzed included central corneal thickness (ccT), corneal nerve density, endothelial cell density (EcD), polymegathism, and pleomorphism. These parameters were compared in the following populations: control, PEX, PEXG, and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Over 30 observational studies were reviewed. Most studies showed a statistically significant lower EcD in PEX and PEXG populations compared to controls. Overall, PEX eyes had a non-statistically significant trend of lower EcDs compared to PEXG eyes. No consistent trends were found when analyzing differences in ccT amongst control, PEX and PEXG groups. For the few studies that looked at corneal nerve characteristics, the control groups were found to have statistically significantly greater nerve densities than PEX eyes, which had significantly greater densities than PEXG eyes. EcD and corneal nerve densities may be potential metrics for risk-stratifying patients with PEX and PEXG. Our literature review provided further evidence of the significant negative influence PEX has on the cornea, worsening as patients convert to PEXG.

The source code analysis of these applications requires the extraction and examination of artifacts, which are build using multiple programming languages along with their dependencies. A large number of studies presented on multilingual source code analysis and its applications in the last one and half decade. The objective of this systematic literature review (SLR) is to summarize state of the art and prominent areas for future research. This SLR is based on different techniques, tools, and methodologies to analyze multilingual source code applications. We finalized 56 multi-discipline published papers relevant to multilingual source code analysis and its applications out of 3820 papers, filtered through multi-stage search criterion. Based on our findings, we highlight research gaps and challenges in the field of multilingual applications. The research findings are presented in the form of research problems, research contributions, challenges, and future prospects. We identified 46 research issues and requirements for analyzing multilingual applications and grouped them in 13 different software engineering domains. We examined the research contributions and mapped them with individual research problems. We presented the research contributions in the form of tools techniques and approaches that are presented in the form of research models, platforms, frameworks, prototype models, and case studies. Every research has its limitations or prospects for future research. We highlighted the limitations and future perspectives and grouped them in various software engineering domains. Most of the research trends and potential research areas are identified in static source code analysis, program comprehension, refactoring, reverse engineering, detection, and traceability of cross-language links, code coverage, security analysis, cross-language parsing, and abstraction of source code models. © 2013 IEEE.","reverse engineering; software architecture; software design; Software engineering; software maintenance","Analytical models; Bibliographies; Codes (symbols); Computer programming languages; Computer software; Computer software maintenance; Data mining; Linguistics; Problem oriented languages; Reverse engineering; Software architecture; Software design; Software engineering; Manuals; Potential researches; Program comprehension; Software applications; Software engineering domain; Source code analysis; Systematic literature review; Systematics; Application programs","Mushtaq, Z.; COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Lahore CampusPakistan; email: zmqazi@gmail.com",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21693536,,,,"English","IEEE Access",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021789175

Based on experience in a large number of SM/SLR studies, we and many other researchers have found the data extraction in SLRs to be time consuming and error-prone, thus raising the real need for heuristics and guidelines for effective and efficient data extraction in these studies, especially to be learnt by junior and young researchers. As a 'guideline' paper, this paper contributes a synthesized list of challenges usually faced during SLRs' data extraction phase and the corresponding solutions (guidelines). For our synthesis, we consider two data sources: (1) the pool of 16 SLR studies in which the authors have been involved in, as well as (2) a review of challenges and guidelines in the existing literature.

Search and selection of primary studies in Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) is labour intensive, and hard to replicate and update. Aims. We explore a machine learning approach to support semi-automated search and selection in SLRs to address these weaknesses. Method. We 1) train a classifier on an initial set of papers, 2) extend this set of papers by automated search and snowballing, 3) have the researcher validate the top paper, selected by the classifier, and 4) update the set of papers and iterate the process until a stopping criterion is met. Results. We demonstrate with a proof-of-concept tool that the proposed automated search and selection approach generates valid search strings and that the performance for subsets of primary studies can reduce the manual work by half. Conclusions. The approach is promising and the demonstrated advantages include cost savings and replicability. The next steps include further tool development and evaluate the approach on a complete SLR. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Automation; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Research identification; Study selection; Systematic literature review","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Learning systems; Paper; Reinforcement learning; Software engineering; Automated searches; Literature studies; Machine learning approaches; Proof of concept; Stopping criteria; Study selection; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Education",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348041,,,"English","ACM Int.

Methods For the SLR, a comprehensive literature search was performed to identify the articles reporting on the serology at renal transplantation (RT) and on the outcome of RT. Studies were critically appraised using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Patients who underwent RT in the TLC were identified and grouped into graft failure and graft survival. The serology in both groups was studied. Results Of the 749 references, 742 did not have serological status of the patient or were not relevant to the research question. Seven studies in addition to TLC (n = 76) were included in the SLR. The NOS revealed limitations because of small sample size and a short follow-up period. The majority of the grafts survived to at least 1 year regardless of the serology results pre-transplant which is consistent with results of the TLC. Overall, 32 of 1783 patients in the TLC had a RT. In all, 2 patients had a nonfunctional graft, 5 patients had graft failure, and 25 patients had graft survival. Overall, 40% of the graft failures had positive serology compared to 52% in the graft survival, 1 year prior to RT. Conclusion The results of this SLR found that the persistence of serological abnormalities at the time of RT was not associated with graft failure. These results are consistent with the results of the TLC. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Lupus nephritis; Outcomes; Renal transplantation; Serology; SLE","complement component C3; complement component C4; double stranded DNA antibody; age distribution; Article; disease duration; ethnic difference; follow up; graft failure; graft survival; human; kidney transplantation; mortality rate; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; outcome assessment; priority journal; renal replacement therapy; serology; sex difference; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment outcome; adult; blood; chronic kidney failure; complication; factual database; female; graft survival; lupus erythematosus nephritis; male; middle aged; prognosis; treatment outcome; Adult; Databases, Factual; Female; Graft Survival; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Kidney Transplantation; Lupus Nephritis; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Treatment Outcome","Touma, Z.; Department of Medicine, University of Toronto Lupus Clinic, Centre for Prognosis Studies in the Rheumatic Diseases, Toronto Western Hospital, EW, 1-412, 399 Bathurst St, Canada; email: zahi.touma@uhn.ca",,"W.B.

Methods: Stochastic transmission compartmental TB model from the healthcare provider perspective with parameter input from direct measurements, systematic literature reviews and expert opinion. MODS and Xpert® MTB/RIF were evaluated as replacement test of smear microscopy (SM) or as an add-on test after a negative SM. Costs were calculated in 2013 USD, effects in disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Willingness to pay threshold (WPT) was established at once the per capita Gross National Income of Mozambique. Results: MODS as an add-on test to negative SM produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5647.89USD/DALY averted. MODS as a substitute for SM yielded an ICER of 5374.58USD/DALY averted. Xpert® MTB/RIF as an add-on test to negative SM yielded ICER of 345.71USD/DALY averted. Xpert® MTB/RIF as a substitute for SM obtained an ICER of 122.13USD/DALY averted. TB prevalence and risk of infection were the main factors impacting MODS and Xpert® MTB/RIF ICER in the one-way sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Xpert® MTB/RIF was most likely to have an ICER below the WPT, whereas MODS was not. Conclusion: Our cost–utility analysis favours the implementation of Xpert® MTB/RIF as a replacement of SM for all TB suspects in this rural high TB/HIV prevalence African setting. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","cost-effectiveness analysis; diagnosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Sub-Saharan Africa","bioassay; cost-benefit analysis; detection method; disease prevalence; drug; health care; health risk; literature review; microscopy; rural population; sensitivity analysis; tuberculosis; vulnerability; Article; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; diagnostic equipment; drug sensitivity; human; major clinical study; microscopic observation drug susceptibility assay; microscopy; Monte Carlo method; Mozambique; mtb rif assay; rural area; sensitivity analysis; smear microscopy; tuberculosis; antibiotic resistance; comparative study; cost; cost benefit analysis; drug effects; economics; genetics; growth, development and aging; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; microscopy; molecular diagnosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; prevalence; quality adjusted life year; rural population; sensitivity and specificity; sputum; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Mozambique; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; bacterial DNA; rifampicin; tuberculostatic agent; Antibiotics, Antitubercular; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Costs and Cost Analysis; DNA, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Microscopy; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Mozambique; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Prevalence; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Rifampin; Rural Population; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sputum; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary","Wikman-Jorgensen, P.E.; Department of Public Health, University of BarcelonaSpain; email: wikman.philip@gmail.com",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13602276,,TMIHF,"28380276","English","Trop.

Methods An SLR for the period between 2013 and 2016 was undertaken to assess the efficacy of glucocorticoids (GCs), conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) (tofacitinib and baricitinib) in randomised clinical trials. Results For GCs, four studies were included in the SLR. Patients without poor prognostic factors experienced benefit when GCs were added to methotrexate (MTX). Lower doses of GCs were similar to higher doses. For csDMARDs, two new studies comparing MTX monotherapy with combination csDMARD were included in the SLR. In the tREACH trial at the end of 12â €..months no difference between the groups in disease activity, functional ability and radiographic progression was seen, using principles of tight control (treat-To-Target). In the CareRA trial, combination therapy with csDMARDs was not superior to MTX monotherapy and monotherapy was better tolerated. For tsDMARDs, tofacitinib and baricitinib were shown to be more effective than placebo (MTX) in different patient populations. Conclusions Addition of GCs to csDMARD therapy may be beneficial but the benefits should be balanced against the risk of toxicity. Under tight control conditions MTX monotherapy is not less effective than combination csDMARDs, but better tolerated. Tofacitinib and baricitinib are efficacious in patients with RA, including those with refractory disease. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","Corticosteroids; DMARDs (synthetic); Rheumatoid Arthritis; Treatment","adalimumab; auranofin; azathioprine; baricitinib; C reactive protein; chlorambucil; colloidal gold; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin A; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; leflunomide; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; minocycline; mycophenolic acid; penicillamine; placebo; salazosulfapyridine; tacrolimus; tofacitinib; triamcinolone; antirheumatic agent; azetidine derivative; baricitinib; glucocorticoid; methotrexate; piperidine derivative; pyrimidine derivative; pyrrole derivative; sulfonamide; tofacitinib; Article; disease activity; disease activity score; disease course; disease severity; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; human; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review; unspecified side effect; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; combination drug therapy; practice guideline; randomized controlled trial (topic); Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Azetidines; Drug Therapy, Combination; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Methotrexate; Piperidines; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Pyrimidines; Pyrroles; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sulfonamides","Chatzidionysiou, K.; Karolinska InstituteSweden; email: aikaterini.chatzidionysiou@karolinska.se",,"BMJ Publishing Group",00034967,,ARDIA,"28356243","English","Ann.

Methods A review of the literature was performed focusing on failed cartilage repair and related treatments. Two of the authors independently screened articles. Conflicts about the inclusion of a paper was resolved by further evaluation by the senior author. Review articles, articles written in languages different from/other than English, case reports, and papers that did not evaluate the outcomes of interest were excluded. Fulltext version of each included paper was obtained and relevant data were extracted and collected in a database. Results At the end of the screening process, 31 articles were included.Microfractures and mosaicplasty showed a nonnegligible failure rate at short- and midterm. Better results, especially in terms of time to failure or revision, were reported with the use of autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation. Regarding the treatment of failed cartilage repair, the use of OCA transplantation in patients with previous failed cartilage repair may be a safe option. The revision of failed OCA transplantation with further OCA seems to have a greater failure rate. Patients with previous failed ACI or matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) who underwent further MACI or ACI reported acceptable results. Otherwise, ACI in patients with history of previous subchondral marrow stimulation (SMS) demonstrated a greater failure rate. Conclusion From the analysis of the literature, OCA transplantation seems to be the most reliable treatment of a failed SMS. ACI or MACI showed acceptable results in patients with previously failed MACI or ACI.

Methods Systematic literature review (SLR) of observational studies comparing any DMARD with another intervention for the management of patients with RA. All safety outcomes were included. A comparator group was required for the study to be included. Risk of bias was assessed with the Hayden's tool. Results Twenty-six observational studies addressing diverse safety outcomes of therapy with bDMARDs met eligibility criteria (15 on serious infections, 4 on malignancies). Substantial heterogeneity precluded meta-Analysis. Together with the evidence from the 2013 SLR, based on 15 studies, 7 at low risk of bias, patients on bDMARDs compared with patients on conventional sDMARDs had a higher risk of serious infections (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.1 to 1.8)-without differences across bDMARDs-a higher risk of tuberculosis (aHR 2.7 to 12.5), but no increased risk of infection by herpes zoster. Patients on bDMARDs did not have an increased risk of malignancies in general, lymphoma or non-melanoma skin cancer, but the risk of melanoma may be slightly increased (aHR 1.5). Conclusions These findings confirm the known safety pattern of bDMARDs, including both tumour necrosis factor-α inhibitor (TNFi) and non-TNFi, for the treatment of RA. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Methods: An SLR was conducted for studies published between 2004 and 2016. Due to study heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were conducted controlling for differences in imputation methods for missing values, baseline pain severity, and type of surgery. Where sufficient data was available, a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) was performed. Results: The MTC and subgroup analyses used 13 studies. In direct meta-analysis, there was a statistically significant difference in favor of SSTS compared with intravenous (IV) PCA (morphine) at 24 hours for the patient global assessment (PGA) scores of “good” or “excellent”. For the Pain Intensity Score, there were numerical but not statistically significant differences in favor of the SSTS versus IV PCA (morphine) and the patient controlled transdermal system (PCTS) (fentanyl) in the MTC at 6 hours (standardized mean difference −0.27 [credible interval −2.78, 2.09] and −0.36 [−3.89, 3.03], respectively). The onset of pain relief was earlier with the SSTS versus IV PCA (morphine) as shown by the Pain Intensity Difference. Likewise, the onset was earlier compared with PCTS (fentanyl) where data was available. There was a significant difference in favor of SSTS compared with IV PCA (morphine) and with PCTS (fentanyl) for any adverse event, and numerical improvements for withdrawals due to adverse events.

Despite the large number of studies and reviews available, the evidence regarding the behavioral determinants of PA is still inconclusive. Thus, the aim of this umbrella systematic literature review (SLR) was to summarize the evidence on the behavioral determinants of PA across the life course. Methods: A systematic online search was conducted on MEDLINE, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus databases. The search was limited to studies published in English from January, 2004 to April, 2016. SLRs and meta-analyses (MAs) of observational studies that investigated the behavioral determinants of PA were considered eligible. The extracted data were assessed based on the importance of the determinants, the strength of evidence, and the methodological quality. The full protocol is available from PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2014:CRD42015010616). Results: Seventeen reviews on 35 behavioral determinants of PA were eligible for this umbrella SLR. Regardless of age, the most investigated determinants were those related with 'screen use' and 'smoking'. For youth, probable positive evidence emerged for 'previous PA' and 'independent mobility and active transport' among children and adolescents. For the adult population, 'transition to university' and 'pregnancy/having a child' showed probable negative associations. Conclusions: Although the majority of the evidence was limited and most of the determinants were not associated with PA, this umbrella SLR provided a comprehensive overview of the associations between behavioral determinants and PA. Youth should be physically active in the early years and increase active transportation to/from school, independent mobility, and 'free-range activities' without adult supervision, whilst adult PA behaviors are mostly influenced by the life events. Finally, more research is needed that incorporates prospective study designs, standardized definitions of PA, objective measurement methods of PA assessment, and the use of interactionist and mediational approaches for the evaluation of different behavioral determinants influencing PA behaviors. © 2017 The Author(s).","Behavioral determinants; Health promotion; Physical activity; Umbrella systematic literature review","active transport; adolescent; adult; child; diet; female; health promotion; human; juvenile; life event; Medline; meta analysis; observational study; physical activity; pregnancy; prospective study; Scopus; smoking; systematic review; university; Web of Science; adolescent behavior; child behavior; diet; exercise; male; school; sedentary lifestyle; traffic and transport; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Adult; Child; Child Behavior; Diet; Exercise; Female; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Pregnancy; Schools; Sedentary Lifestyle; Transportation","Condello, G.; Department of Movement, Human and Health Sciences, University of Rome Foro Italico, P.za Lauro de Bosis, 15, Italy; email: giancarlo.condello@gmail.com",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14795868,,,"28464958","English","Int.

Such immature practices lead to various negative outcomes, e.g., ineffectiveness of testing practices in detecting all the defects, and cost and schedule overruns of testing activities. To conduct test maturity assessment (TMA) and test process improvement (TPI) in a systematic manner, various TMA/TPI models and approaches have been proposed. Objective It is important to identify the state-of-the-art and the –practice in this area to consolidate the list of all various test maturity models proposed by practitioners and researchers, the drivers of TMA/TPI, the associated challenges and the benefits and results of TMA/TPI. Our article aims to benefit the readers (both practitioners and researchers) by providing the most comprehensive survey of the area, to this date, in assessing and improving the maturity of test processes. Method To achieve the above objective, we have performed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) study to find out what we know about TMA/TPI. A MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). We searched the academic literature using the Google Scholar and the grey literature using the regular Google search engine. Results Our MLR and its results are based on 181 sources, 51 (29%) of which were grey literature and 130 (71%) were formally published sources. By summarizing what we know about TMA/TPI, our review identified 58 different test maturity models and a large number of sources with varying degrees of empirical evidence on this topic. We also conducted qualitative analysis (coding) to synthesize the drivers, challenges and benefits of TMA/TPI from the primary sources. Conclusion We show that current maturity models and techniques in TMA/TPI provides reasonable advice for industry and the research community. We suggest directions for follow-up work, e.g., using the findings of this MLR in industry-academia collaborative projects and empirical evaluation of models and techniques in the area of TMA/TPI as reported in this article. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Multivocal literature review; Software testing; Systematic literature review; Test management; Test maturity; Test process; Test process assessment; Test process improvement","Process engineering; Search engines; Testing; Collaborative projects; Empirical evaluations; Literature reviews; Research communities; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Test management; Test process; Software testing","Garousi, V.; Software Engineering Research Group, Department of Computer Engineering, Hacettepe UniversityTurkey; email: vahid.garousi@hacettepe.edu.tr",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009743225

This study utilizes a technique of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to provide a comprehensive review of the existing evidence within the topic of interest. This SLR aims to identify possible approaches to improving the current study of APA, particularly in generating test data for structural testing. The results of this study revealed that there is a clear gap within the perspective context of the covered areas. Particularly, in software testing, the findings show that Meta-Heuristic techniques are among the popular techniques that were applied to realize Automated Test Data Generation (ATDG) for structural testing.

Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Agile software development; Mapping study; Systematic literature reviews; Tertiary study","Agile manufacturing systems; Embedded systems; Human resource management; Mapping; Project management; Social aspects; Agile software development; Global software engineering; Mapping studies; Product line engineering; Review recommendations; Software product line engineerings; Systematic literature review; Tertiary study; Software design","Hoda, R.Building 903, 368 Khyber Pass, New Market, New Zealand; email: r.hoda@auckland.ac.nz",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009961943

As mobile phone access and ownership become more common globally, mobile phone surveys (MPSs) offer an opportunity to supplement traditional public health household surveys. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the current landscape of MPSs to collect population-level estimates in low-And middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: Primary and gray literature from 7 online databases were systematically searched for studies that deployed MPSs to collect population-level estimates. Titles and abstracts were screened on primary inclusion and exclusion criteria by two research assistants. Articles that met primary screening requirements were read in full and screened for secondary eligibility criteria. Articles included in review were grouped into the following three categories by their survey modality: (1) interactive voice response (IVR), (2) short message service (SMS), and (3) human operator or computer-Assisted telephone interviews (CATI). Data were abstracted by two research assistants. The conduct and reporting of the review conformed to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Results: A total of 6625 articles were identified through the literature review. Overall, 11 articles were identified that contained 19 MPS (CATI, IVR, or SMS) surveys to collect population-level estimates across a range of topics. MPSs were used in Latin America (n=8), the Middle East (n=1), South Asia (n=2), and sub-Saharan Africa (n=8). Nine articles presented results for 10 CATI surveys (10/19, 53%). Two articles discussed the findings of 6 IVR surveys (6/19, 32%). Three SMS surveys were identified from 2 articles (3/19, 16%). Approximately 63% (12/19) of MPS were delivered to mobile phone numbers collected from previously administered household surveys. The majority of MPS (11/19, 58%) were panel surveys where a cohort of participants, who often were provided a mobile phone upon a face-To-face enrollment, were surveyed multiple times. Conclusions: Very few reports of population-level MPS were identified. Of the MPS that were identified, the majority of surveys were conducted using CATI. Due to the limited number of identified IVR and SMS surveys, the relative advantages and disadvantages among the three survey modalities cannot be adequately assessed. The majority of MPS were sent to mobile phone numbers that were collected from a previously administered household survey. There is limited evidence on whether a random digit dialing (RDD) approach or a simple random sample of mobile network provided list of numbers can produce a population representative survey. © 2017 Adrian Aguilera, Emma Bruehlman-Senecal, Orianna Demasi, Patricia Avila.","Cellular phone; Computer-Assisted telephone interview; Interactive voice response; Mobile phone surveys; Short messages service; Survey methodology","developing country; human; middle aged; mobile phone; questionnaire; utilization; Cell Phone; Developing Countries; Humans; Middle Aged; Surveys and Questionnaires","Gibson, D.G.; Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 615 N Wolfe St, United States; email: dgibso28@jhu.edu",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,"28476725","English","J.

However, GSD is a complex phenomenon and there are many challenges associated with it, especially that related to Software Process Improvement (SPI). The aim of this work is to identify humans' related factors that can positively impact the SPI process in GSD organizations and proposed a hypothetical framework of the identified success factors in relation to SPI implementation. We have adopted the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method in order to identify the success factors. Using the SLR approach, total ten success factors were identified. The paper also reported the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for SPI implementation following the criteria of the factors having a frequency ≥ 50% as critical. Our results reveal that five out of ten factors are critical for SPI program. Based on the analysis of the identified success factors, we have presented a hypothetical framework that has highlighted an association between the identified success factors and the implementation of the SPI program in GSD environment.

Methods We conducted (1) a systematic literature review (SLR) of domains assessed in PsA; (2) international focus groups to identify domains important to people with PsA; (3) two international surveys with patients and physicians to prioritise domains; (4) an international face-To-face meeting with patients and physicians using the nominal group technique method to agree on the most important domains; and (5) presentation and votes at the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) conference in May 2016. All phases were performed in collaboration with patient research partners. Results We identified 39 unique domains through the SLR (24 domains) and international focus groups (34 domains). 50 patients and 75 physicians rated domain importance. During the March 2016 consensus meeting, 12 patients and 12 physicians agreed on 10 candidate domains. Then, 49 patients and 71 physicians rated these domains' importance. Five were important to >70% of both groups: musculoskeletal disease activity, skin disease activity, structural damage, pain and physical function. Fatigue and participation were important to >70% of patients. Patient global and systemic inflammation were important to >70% of physicians. The updated PsA core domain set endorsed by 90% of OMERACT 2016 participants includes musculoskeletal disease activity, skin disease activity, pain, patient global, physical function, health-related quality of life, fatigue and systemic inflammation. Conclusions The updated PsA core domain set incorporates patients' and physicians' priorities and evolving PsA research. Next steps include identifying outcome measures that adequately assess these domains. © 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","Outcomes research; Psoriatic Arthritis; Qualitative research; Spondyloarthritis","Article; dactylitis; disease activity; enthesitis; fatigue; human; inflammation; information processing; longitudinal study; major clinical study; musculoskeletal disease; observational study; outcome assessment; outcomes research; productivity; psoriatic arthritis; quality of life; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatology; skin disease; systematic review; adolescent; adult; aged; Arthritis, Psoriatic; clinical trial (topic); complication; consensus; consensus development; fatigue; female; health personnel attitude; health status; inflammation; international cooperation; literature; male; middle aged; pain; pathophysiology; patient-reported outcome; physician; questionnaire; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Trials as Topic; Consensus; Fatigue; Female; Focus Groups; Health Status; Humans; Inflammation; Internationality; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Physicians; Quality of Life; Review Literature as Topic; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","Orbai, A.-M.; Division of Rheumatology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Hopkins Bayview Circle, AAC-1B, United States; email: aorbai1@jhmi.edu",,"BMJ Publishing Group",00034967,,ARDIA,"27613807","English","Ann.

This paper follows systematic literature review (SLR) procedures with snowballing approach as the main method. Relevant articles were mainly selected by referring to the Association of Information Systems (AIS) and thus, are relevant to the IS academic community. This paper synthesized the six elements for green IS design framework namely context, goals, roles, design principles, functions and features. This provides a foundation for the future green IS design framework. The evidence indicates that there is absence of metrics in measuring green IS design, which is valuable in assessing such systems. © 2005-ongoing JATIT & LLS.","Design; Framework; Green IS; Snowballing; Systematic literature review",,,,"Asian Research Publishing Network",19928645,,,,"English","J.

Objective: In order to cope with the complexity of specifying SCS by RE, we investigate the approaches proposed to improve the communication or integration between RE and safety engineering in SCS development. We analyze the activities that should be performed by RE during safety analysis, the hazard/safety techniques it could use, the relationships between safety information that it should specify, the tools to support safety analysis as well as integration benefits between these areas. Method: We use a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the basis for our work. Results: We developed four taxonomies to help RE during specification of SCS that classify: techniques used in (1) hazard analysis; (2) safety analysis; (3) safety-related information and (4) a detailed set of information regarding hazards specification. Conclusions: This paper is a step towards developing a body of knowledge in safety concerns necessary to RE in the specification of SCS that is derived from a large-scale SLR.

Thus the models should be easy to comprehend and maintain, which is directly related to their complexity. In order to systematically address process models complexity, it has to be measured. Objective The goal of our work was to provide a better overview and understanding in the field of process models complexity and to provide an overview of the corresponding metrics. Method A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted, being the most suitable method for achieving aforementioned goals. In addition, to answer the stated research questions, different techniques for qualitative and quantitative data analysis and synthesis were used. Results We identified 43 relevant articles which were systematically analyzed according to a pre-defined process and data acquisition form. Out of these articles we collected 66 process models complexity metrics. Conclusion Modelers can use the ‘catalogue’ of process complexity metrics to establish and ensure good quality of diagrams, whereas researches can relate to or extend the ‘catalogue’ by providing new metrics or new insights to existing ones. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Complexity measurement; Metrics; Process diagram; Process model; Systematic literature review","Data acquisition; Complexity measurement; Metrics; Process diagram; Process Modeling; Systematic literature review; Computational complexity","Polančič, G.; University of Maribor, Institute of informatics, Smetanova 17, Slovenia; email: gregor.polancic@um.si",,"Elsevier B.V.",09205489,,CSTIE,,"English","Comput Stand Interfaces",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007398131

Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common clinical form of MS and affects ~85% of cases at onset. Highly active (HA) and rapidly evolving severe (RES) RRMS are 2 forms of RRMS amenable to disease-modifying therapies (DMT). This study explored the efficacy of fingolimod relative to other DMTs for the treatment of HA and RES RRMS. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify published randomised controlled trials in HA and RES RRMS. Identified evidence was vetted, and a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) was performed to evaluate the relative efficacy of fingolimod versus dimethyl fumarate (DMF) in HA RRMS and versus natalizumab in RES RRMS. Results: For HA RRMS, the SLR identified 2 studies with relevant patient subgroup data: 1 comparing fingolimod with placebo and the other comparing DMF with placebo. 3 studies were found for RES RRMS: 1 comparing fingolimod with placebo and 2 studies comparing natalizumab with placebo. NMA results in the HA population showed a favourable numerical trend of fingolimod versus DMF assessed for annualised relapse rate (ARR) and 3-month confirmed disability progression. For the RES population, the results identified an increase of ARR and 3-month confirmed disability progression for fingolimod versus natalizumab (not statistically significant). Sparse study data and the consequently high uncertainty around the estimates restricted our ability to demonstrate statistical significance in the studied subgroups. Conclusions: Data limitations are apparent when conducting an informative indirect comparison for the HA and RES RRMS subgroups as the subgroups analyses were retrospective analyses of studies powered to indicate differences across entire study populations. Comparisons across treatments in HA or RES RRMS will be associated with high levels of uncertainty until new data are collected for these subgroups.",,"fingolimod; fumaric acid dimethyl ester; natalizumab; placebo; fingolimod; fumaric acid dimethyl ester; immunologic factor; immunosuppressive agent; natalizumab; annualised relapse rate; Article; Bayes theorem; disease modifying therapy; drug efficacy; highly active multiple sclerosis; highly active multiple sclerosis; human; meta analysis; multicenter study (topic); multiple sclerosis; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); randomized controlled trial (topic); rapidly evolving multiple sclerosis; rapidly evolving multiple sclerosis; recurrence risk; systematic review; therapy; comparative study; female; male; multiple sclerosis; recurrent disease; severity of illness index; Dimethyl Fumarate; Female; Fingolimod Hydrochloride; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Immunosuppressive Agents; Male; Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-Remitting; Natalizumab; Recurrence; Severity of Illness Index","Adlard, N.; Novartis PharmaceuticalsUnited Kingdom; email: nicholas.adlard@novartis.com",,"BMJ Publishing Group",20446055,,,"28283486","English","BMJ Open",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015189247

This often leads to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment of patients resulting in poor health outcomes, exacerbating this already debilitating condition. This review evaluated 12 primary diagnostic accuracy studies that specifically assessed the performance of various individual and grouped clinical neurological tests in detecting nerve root impingement, as established in the current literature. Methods: Eight electronic data bases were searched for relevant articles from inception until July 2016. All primary diagnostic studies which investigated the accuracy of clinical neurological test (s) in diagnosing lumbar radiculopathy among patients with low back and referred leg symptoms were screened for inclusion. Qualifying studies were retrieved and independently assessed for methodological quality using the 'Quality Assessment of Diagnostic tests Accuracy Studies' criteria. Results: A total of 12 studies which investigated standard components of clinical neurological examination of (sensory, motor, tendon reflex and neuro-dynamics) of the lumbo-sacral spine were included. The mean inter-observer agreement on quality assessment by two independent reviewers was fair (k = 0.3 - 0.7). The diagnostic performance of sensory testing using MR imaging as a reference standard demonstrated a sensitivity (confidence interval 95%) 0.61 (0.47-0.73) and a specificity of 0.63 (0.38-0.84). Motor tests sensitivity was poor to moderate, ranging from 0.13 (0.04-0.31) to 0.61 (0.36-0.83). Generally, the diagnostic performance of reflex testing was notably good with specificity ranging from (confidence interval 95%) 0.60 (0.51-0.69) to 0.93 (0.87-0.97) and sensitivity ranging from 0.14 (0.09-0.21) to 0.67 (0.21-0.94). Femoral nerve stretch test had a high sensitivity of (confidence interval 95%) 1.00 (0.40-1.00) and specificity of 0.83 (0.52-0.98) while SLR test recorded a mean sensitivity of 0.84 (0.72-0.92) and specificity of 0.78 (0.67-0.87). Conclusions: There is a scarcity of studies on the diagnostic accuracy of clinical neurological examination testing. Furthermore there seem to be a disconnect among researchers regarding the diagnostic utility of lower limb neuro-dynamic tests which include the Straight Leg Raise and Femoral Nerve tests for sciatic and femoral nerve respectively. Whether these tests are able to detect the presence of disc herniation and subsequent nerve root compression or hyper-sensitivity of the sacral and femoral plexus due to mechanical irritation still remains debatable. © 2017 The Author(s).","Clinical neurological examination; Diagnostic accuracy; Lumbar radiculopathy","clinical examination; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; electrodiagnosis; electromyography; false negative result; false positive result; femoral nerve stretch test; human; intermethod comparison; low back pain; lumbosacral radiculopathy; lumbosacral spine; motor dysfunction assessment; myeloradiculopathy; neurologic examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; referred pain; Review; sensitivity and specificity; sensory evaluation; straight leg raise; symptom; systematic review; tendon reflex; x-ray computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; intervertebral disk degeneration; intervertebral disk hernia; low back pain; lumbar vertebra; neurologic examination; procedures; radiculopathy; sacrum; standards; Humans; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Intervertebral Disc Displacement; Low Back Pain; Lumbar Vertebrae; Neurologic Examination; Radiculopathy; Sacrum","Tawa, N.; Department of Rehabilitative Sciences, College of Health Sciences, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, P.

The SCRM literature seems to require studies that utilize risk typology, sources of risk, etc. for reviewing the topic. The purpose of this paper is to bridge the gap by synthesizing the information obtained from 343 articles across 85 journals. This study also presents a critical analysis of the content of SCRM in a structured manner to identify the directions for future research. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was devised and adopted, which involved the selection, classification, and evaluation of 343 research articles published over a period of 11 years (2004-2014). The content of extant SCRM literature was critically analyzed and synthesized from the perspective of the risk management process (RMP). Findings: The analysis of extant literature shows that there is a marked rise in research in the SCRM area, especially after the year 2005. It was observed that not only risk but also different forms of uncertainties make supply chain (SC) operations difficult to manage. The SCRM actions yielded most benefits when their implementation was at chain or network level and managed strategically. The analysis also reveals that the manufacturing sector is most affected by risks and highly investigated by researchers. Practical implications: A complete process for SCRM based on risk stratification, objectives of risk management, and RMP will be a guiding model for firms to manage risks. The research gaps identified and future directions provided here will encourage researchers and managers to devise new methods, tools, and techniques to address the risks in modern SC operations. Originality/value: An SLR and risk-based content classification of SCRM literature were performed. To identify, locate, select, and analyze the SCRM literature, a structured and systematic process was adopted with some very rarely used methods such as two levels of search keywords, and strings were formulated to locate the most relevant articles in major academic databases. © 2017, 2017, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Content analysis; Risk management; Risk management process; Supply chain management; Systematic literature review",,"Soni, G.; Mechanical Engineering Department, Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: gunjan1980@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09727981,,,,"English","J.

The domain from which such knowledge is extracted is typically existing research literature found in journals, conference proceedings, books and gray literature. Empirical approaches that include various systematic review (SR) methodologies such as systematic literature review (SLR) and systematic mapping study (SMS) are found to be effective in this context. They adopt rigorous planning, follow repeatable and well-defined processes, and produce unbiased and evidence-based outcomes. Despite these significant benefits, the general trend on using these systematic review (SR) methodologies is not encouraging in SE research. The primary reasons emerging are twofold - a) SR methodologies are largely cited as time-consuming activities and b) lack of guidance to conduct systematic reviews. This tutorial discusses these concerns and describes an effective way of using SR methodologies for SE research. Objectives: Attendees will be introduced to the key concepts, methods and processes for conducting systematic literature reviews (SLR) and systematic mapping studies (SMS). The benefits, limitations, guidelines for using SR methodologies in an effective manner will discussed in the session. Attendees will be guided on the appropriate formulation of a research question and sub questions; the development of a review protocol such as inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, quality criteria and classification structures; and execution of review protocol using digital libraries and syntheses of review data. A web based software tool1, for supporting the systematic literature review process will be demonstrated and attendees will get the opportunity to use the tool to conduct the review to help in identification of relevant research and extraction and synthesis of data. Method: We will use a blend of information presentation, interactive hands-on session and knowledge sharing session. The presentation will introduce the key concepts, benefits, limitations and how to overcome the limitations; hands on session will illustrate a review process with a case study, and finally the knowledge sharing session will discuss the experiences, best practices and the lesson learnt. © 2017 ACM.","Literature review; Meta modeling; Model based literature review; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping study","Digital libraries; Knowledge management; Mapping; Classification structure; Information presentation; Literature reviews; Meta model; Scientific decisions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic mapping studies; Software engineering",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348560,,,"English","ACM Int.

We report on the SE/MP trade-off in the context of an ongoing systematic literature review (SLR). After characterizing the issue of the SE/MP trade-off using two examples from our own research, we (1) review the 33 identified articles that assess the trade-off, (2) summarize the proposed solutions for the tradeoff, and (3) discuss the findings for SSE and future work. Overall, we see evidence for the SE/MP trade-off and first solution approaches. However, a strong empirical foundation has yet to be established; general quantitative metrics and methods supporting software developers in addressing the trade-off have to be developed. We foresee considerable future work in SSE across scientific communities. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Computer software; Construction; Efficiency; Engineering research; Scalability; Software engineering; Building simulation; Dynamic construction; Empirical foundations; Large scale simulations; Quantitative metrics; Scientific community; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Economic and social effects",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052240,,,"English","Proc.

In recent years, it has gained significant attention in agile software development (ASD). Objective The purpose of this study is to analyze and synthesize the state of the art of TD, and its causes, consequences, and management strategies in the context of ASD. Research Method Using a systematic literature review (SLR), 38 primary studies, out of 346 studies, were identified and analyzed. Results We found five research areas of interest related to the literature of TD in ASD. Among those areas, “managing TD in ASD” received the highest attention, followed by “architecture in ASD and its relationship with TD”. In addition, eight categories regarding the causes and five categories regarding the consequences of incurring TD in ASD were identified. “Focus on quick delivery” and “architectural and design issues” were the most popular causes of incurring TD in ASD. “Reduced productivity”, “system degradation” and “increased maintenance cost” were identified as significant consequences of incurring TD in ASD. Additionally, we found 12 strategies for managing TD in the context of ASD, out of which “refactoring” and “enhancing the visibility of TD” were the most significant. Conclusion The results of this study provide a structured synthesis of TD and its management in the context of ASD as well as potential research areas for further investigation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Agile software development; Systematic literature review; Technical debt; Technical debt management","Software engineering; Agile software development; Management strategies; Potential researches; Software development practices; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technical debts; Technical stakeholders; Software design","Behutiye, W.N.; University of OuluFinland; email: woub.behutiye@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84993990146

Currently, there is a lack of effective modifying therapies and treatments for IPF as the underlying epidemiological mechanism is not clearly understood. This leads to difficulty in diagnosing and managing IPF, which results in a high incurment of disease-associated cost. Even though IPF poses a substantial economic burden, there is a lack of research available on cost triggers and healthcare utilization, which can be a barrier to future economic evaluations of new medicines for IPF. Objectives: We aimed to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the key cost-generating events of IPF and to gather any related costing information. Results: The data showed that the main events triggering high resource use in patients were the symptoms of IPF progression along with comorbidities and lung transplantations. These events result in a high economic impact through the use of medications, health care professionals, and hospital stays. Conclusion: More research is needed to identify the direct, and indirect, relationships between IPF events and the costs they generate. This would help to further evaluate the area of need for future health technologies and to understand what events should be targeted to reduce the global economic burden of IPF. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cost; Cost triggers; Economic impact; Financial burden; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; Systematic review","comorbidity; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; fibrosing alveolitis; health care cost; health care personnel; health care utilization; human; lung function; lung transplantation; patient-reported outcome; prevalence; priority journal; Review; survival rate; complication; drug cost; economics; fibrosing alveolitis; health service; hospitalization; statistics and numerical data; Comorbidity; Drug Costs; Health Care Costs; Health Services Needs and Demand; Hospitalization; Humans; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis; Lung Transplantation","Vaidya, S.Steinhofstrasse 15C, Switzerland; email: shalvaree.vaidya@stud.unilu.ch",,"Springer New York LLC",03412040,,LUNGD,"27866277","English","Lung",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995802740

Despite optimism, the strength of the evidence supporting this assertion has been limited. In this systematic review the body of evidence related to economic evaluations of mHealth interventions is assessed and summarized. Methods Seven electronic bibliographic databases, grey literature, and relevant references were searched. Eligibility criteria included original articles, comparison of costs and consequences of interventions (one categorized as a primary mHealth intervention or mHealth intervention as a component of other interventions), health and economic outcomes and published in English. Full economic evaluations were appraised using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist and The PRISMA guidelines were followed. Results Searches identified 5902 results, of which 318 were examined at full text, and 39 were included in this review. The 39 studies spanned 19 countries, most of which were conducted in upper and upper-middle income countries (34, 87.2%). Primary mHealth interventions (35, 89.7%), behavior change communication type interventions (e.g., improve attendance rates, medication adherence) (27, 69.2%), and short messaging system (SMS) as the mHealth function (e.g., used to send reminders, information, provide support, conduct surveys or collect data) (22, 56.4%) were most frequent; the most frequent disease or condition focuses were outpatient clinic attendance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The average percent of CHEERS checklist items reported was 79.6% (range 47.62±100, STD 14.18) and the top quartile reported 91.3±100%. In 29 studies (74.3%), researchers reported that the mHealth intervention was cost-effective, economically beneficial, or cost saving at base case. Conclusions Findings highlight a growing body of economic evidence for mHealth interventions. Although all studies included a comparison of intervention effectiveness of a health-related outcome and reported economic data, many did not report all recommended economic outcome items and were lacking in comprehensive analysis. The identified economic evaluations varied by disease or condition focus, economic outcome measurements, perspectives, and were distributed unevenly geographically, limiting formal meta-Analysis. Further research is needed in low and low-middle income countries and to understand the impact of different mHealth types. Following established economic reporting guidelines will improve this body of research. © 2017 Iribarren et al.

However, there are not many papers that study this issue holistically and uncover the current state of this integration. Aim: This study sets out to answer the following research question: What is the current state of integration between agile processes and usability? Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS). A SMS is a form of systematic literature review that aims to identify and classify the research papers published about a specified issue. Results: We retrieved a total of 161 primary studies, which we categorized according to four criteria: process, practice, team and technology integration. The largest group refers to process integration with a total of 76 primary studies. Judging by the increase in the number of publications over the last decade, the integration of human-computer interaction (HCI) activities and techniques into the ASDP is an issue of notable interest. Conclusions: There are very few papers that study the literature holistically and report the current state of usability in the ASDP. Additionally, there are no formalized proposals for adopting usability techniques in ASDP. © 2016 IEEE.","Agile software development; systematic mapping study; usability; user-centred design","Data visualization; Human computer interaction; Mapping; Software engineering; Usability engineering; User centered design; Agile software development; Agile software development process; Human computer interaction (HCI); Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Technology Integration; usability; Usability techniques; Software design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016334,,,"English","Proc.

Method: We identified 170 secondary studies that were reviewed to answer a set of Research Questions (RQ) related to the practical conduction of secondary studies in SE. Results: Results show that both SLRs and SMs have generic RQs, broad search strings, and adopt automatic search as search strategy. However, quality assessment has been more widely adopted in SLRs. Conclusions: In practice, only the quality assessment is conducted differently in SLRs and SMs.","Secondary studies; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping","Knowledge engineering; Mapping; Automatic searches; Quality assessment; Research questions; Search strategies; Secondary studies; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Tertiary study; Software engineering",,,"Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School",23259000,1891706411,,,"English","Proc.

Important decisions need to be made about the various choices involved in the SLR planning phase. However, due to the necessarily comprehensive and rigorous nature of SLR, many researchers have difficulties in planning SLRs sufficiently and effectively. In recent decades, the use of text mining (TM) techniques has been introduced to facilitate SLR process, especially at conducting review phase to support the searching and selection of studies. However, so far, TM techniques have not been applied to support any activities during SLR planning phase. In this research, we proposed a method that apply Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) method to support decision-making activities within the SLR planning phase. This method also known as SLR Planning Based on Suffix Tree Clustering (SLRP-STC) method. It aims to help reviewers in three ways: 1) to extract research topics easily; 2) to better interpret extracted information; and 3) to quickly realize and refine a proposed search string that is poorly formulated or inappropriate. A case study was conducted by comparing the proposed method with manual approach.

Method: To update these two SLRs, we used automated techniques based on VTM (Visual Text Mining) to guarantee the presence of relevant studies. Results: From our experience, some factors to satisfactorily update SLRs were identified: (i) to adopt software tools to support the updating process; (ii) to provide as much as possible information of previous SLR; (iii) to involve researchers from previous SLR; and (iv) to reuse protocol from preliminar SLR. Conclusions: Reported lessons learned can be used as a basis of knowledge to guide researchers when updating their SLRs.","Systematic literature review; Update; VTM","Computer software reusability; Data mining; Knowledge engineering; Automated techniques; Experience report; New study; Systematic literature review; Text mining; Update; Software engineering",,,"Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School",23259000,1891706411,,,"English","Proc.

Although the volume of methodological articles and books focusing on the SLR is growing, certain aspects of this methodological approach seem to be neglected. Firstly, literature focused on the SLR concentrates mainly on conducting the review by one person and is not giving details or guidelines on how to cooperate in teams. Secondly, despite a decent number of the SLR articles in scientific journals, information about the analytical and synthesis part of the SLR lacks details. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe in detail the procedures and the tools used during one SLR conducted by a team of five researchers. Moreover, as the team content analysis was used for the analytical part of the literature review detail description of the activities and the used tools during the content analysis is presented. This article is framed as a descriptive single case study that is based on project documents, communication, meetings minutes and observations conducted by me in the role of the SLR team leader. The described SLR is the first phase of a three year research project that focuses on the ways of using feedback from customers as knowledge for new product or service development and innovations. Besides the detailed description of the whole process, this article also discusses some factors that were influencing the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of the team management.

However, businesses are still sceptical of adopting it because of the different issues that come with it. This study uses systematic literature review (SLR) process to identify and analyse potential barriers in cloud adaptation. The data required to conduct this study is extracted from 84 research studies via SLR process. The studies selection and data extraction process is based on a well-documented protocol. A list of 50 barriers has been identified after synthesising the extracted data.

One precarious step in applying this methodology is to enterprise and perform appropriate and effective search approach. This is a time-consuming and error-prone step, which needs to be carefully planned and implemented. There is an apparent need for a systematic approach to designing and performing a suitable search strategy for optimally retrieving the target literature from digital libraries. To the best of our knowledge, five intensive review papers [1-5] have been found which are not SLR, instead they are a normal survey or literature review. In contrast to [1-9] this paper followed general guidelines for undertaking SLR in order to illustrate necessity, challenges, applications, and attacks of watermarking relational database. An advanced search has been performed in most relevant digital libraries to obtain potentially relevant articles published until the end of 2014. Forty-six primary studies (PSs) have been identified based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The analytical study is mainly based on the PSs to achieve the objectives. The results illustrate the importance of digital watermark in protecting the relational database, the differences between watermarking relational database and multimedia objects and the demand to increase the level of attack resilience. In addition, the results indicate that watermarking relational database is an interested area for researchers.","Database; Database watermarking; Systematic literature review; Watermarking multimedia objects",,,,"Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka",21801843,,,,"English","J.

It is the first task in opinion mining process. The difference between subjectivity analysis and polarity determination is the latter process subjective text to determine the orientation as positive or negative. There were many techniques used to solve the problem of segregating subjective and objective text. This paper used systematic literature review (SLR) to compile the undertaking study in subjective analysis. SLR is a literature review that collects multiple and critically analyse multiple studies to answer the research questions. Eight research questions were drawn for this purpose. Information such as technique, corpus, subjective clues representation and performance were extracted from 97 articles known as primary studies. This information was analysed to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the technique, affecting elements to the performance and missing elements from the subjectivity analysis. The SLR has found that majority of the study are using machine learning approach to identify and learn subjective text due to the nature of subjectivity analysis problem that is viewed as classification problem. The performance of this approach outperformed other approaches though currently it is at satisfactory level. Therefore, more studies are needed to improve the performance of subjectivity analysis.","Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Subjectivity analysis; Systematic literature review",,,,"International Center for Scientific Research and Studies",20748523,,,,"English","Int.

Nevertheless, there is no available study that provides detail review of the published software process improvement SLRs. Objective: The aim of this article is to classify the SLRs of SPI in order to identify the main research areas covered and evaluate the quality of the published SLRs. Methodology: A tertiary study was conducted to review the SLRs published by other researchers on the topic of SPI. Results: Twenty-four SLR articles were identified in the field of SPI. Results show that the quality of the selected SLRs on SPI is decreasing over the recent years. The most popular research topics are factors affecting SPI and process models. Conclusions: This study provides the review and state of the art in the context of SPI research. The results of this article would be of great interest for future SPI researchers by providing in depth understanding of various research areas in SPI. The number of process improvement SLRs is increasing and the overall quality is decreasing, which could lessen their potential impact on SPI practice. Currently, SPI literature is weak in the knowledge areas such as quality and software testing process improvement. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Software process improvement; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Tertiary study","Process engineering; Software testing; In-depth understanding; Software Process Improvement; Software process improvements; Software testing process improvements; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic mapping; Tertiary study; Software design","Khan, A.A.; Department of Computer Science, City University of Hong KongHong Kong; email: aliakhan2-c@my.cityu.edu.hk","Messnarz R.Stolfa J.Stolfa S.O'Connor R.V.","Springer Verlag",18650929,9783319642178,,,"English","Commun.

Design/methodology/approach: The SLR followed two steps, namely, search for articles on the subject and content analysis of selected material and bibliometric analysis of publications using VOSviewer®. Findings: The SLR allowed the compilation of evidences regarding pharmaceutical RL in the groups: environmental risk, the RL evolution and regulatory and stakeholder’s educational perspective. Despite the timid specific literature on pharmaceutical RL, it was also possible to point out research gaps and opportunities. Pharmaceutical RL seems to be influenced by studies from traditional RL including mathematical modeling, managerial strategies and technologies but prescind of a systemic solution. Besides reducing environmental impact, the motivation to implement pharmaceutical RL resides in its potential for revenue. Considering integrated logistics as a trend and an emerging issue, RL for the pharmaceutical industry needs to be addressed more thorough and broadly. Research limitations/implications: The limited number of papers returned in this SLR of pharmaceutical RL impaired the bibliometric analysis of them, leading to the inclusion of papers on general RL. Originality/value: This study provides an overview of the evolution of RL in the pharmaceutical industry, it also clarifies concepts and EOL/EOU practices, particularly directed to the pharmaceutical industry RL. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Pharmaceuticals; Reverse logistics; Systematic literature review",,"de Campos, E.A.R.; Department of Industrial Engineering, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)Brazil; email: earcamp@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13598546,,,,"English","Supply Chain Manage.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028344473

The study of Knowledge Management System (KMS) issues are based on Systematic Literature Review (SLR). It aims to analyze the state of the art, identify current popular issues on KMS, and offer directions for future research agenda. The methodology used in this paper is based on the systematic literature review to collect, synthesize and analyze numerous papers on a variety of topics that are closely related to knowledge management system issues that published in the last two decades. Based on fifty-four papers reviewed from six electronic databases, the result of this paper obtained fourteen current issues on knowledge management system. Moreover, the top three popular issues consist of the development of capabilities and features of KMS, Big Data issues on KMS, and adoption to new technology issue for KMS respectively. The conclusion of this study emphasized the big data phenomenon as the most contemporary topic for the future research area besides the growing of required KMS capabilities and features development. © 2017 The Authors.

Although software engineers use new methods to evaluate the quality of their software, there are still some concerns in several of the methods they use when developing software, for example, when using Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). One of the main goals of DSLs is to ease the work of developers in different areas. However, to achieve this goal it is necessary to provide an evaluation of the usability of such languages. Although it is possible to find some experiments to evaluate such languages, usually this experiments are subjective and do not use techniques from the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) area. Therefore, this paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in which a discussion on the usability of DSLs is presented. This paper also presents a mapping to show how usability has been assessed by researchers in their work. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Domain-Specific Languages; Human-Computer Interaction; Systematic Literature Review; Usability evaluation","Computer software; Digital subscriber lines; Human computer interaction; Problem oriented languages; Usability engineering; Computer programming languages; Quality control; User interfaces; Domain specific languages; Human computer interaction (HCI); Software developer; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Usability evaluation; Quality control; Human computer interaction","Poltronieri Rodrigues, I.; PUCRS - Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do SulBrazil; email: ildevana.rodrigues@acad.pucrs.br",,"Springer Verlag",03029743,,,,"English","Lect.

Hybrid development models, with the integration of User-Centered Design (UCD), are applied with the aim to deliver competitive products with a suitable User Experience (UX). Therefore, stakeholder and user involvement during Requirements Engineering (RE) are essential in order to establish a collaborative environment with constant feedback loops. The aim of this study is to capture the current state of the art of the literature related to Agile RE with focus on stakeholder and user involvement. In particular, we investigate what approaches exist to involve stakeholder in the process, which methodologies are commonly used to present the user perspective and how requirements management is been carried out. We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with an extensive quality assessment of the included studies. We identified 27 relevant papers. After analyzing them in detail, we derive deep insights to the following aspects of Agile RE: stakeholder and user involvement, data gathering, user perspective, integrated methodologies, shared understanding, artifacts, documentation and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR). Agile RE is a complex research field with cross-functional influences. This study will contribute to the software development body of knowledge by assessing the involvement of stakeholder and user in Agile RE, providing methodologies that make ASD more human-centric and giving an overview of requirements management in ASD. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Agile software development; Human-computer interaction; Requirements Engineering; Systematic literature review; User-centered design","Human computer interaction; Product design; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; User centered design; Agile software development; Collaborative environments; Integrated methodology; Nonfunctional requirements; Requirements management; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); User Centered Design(UCD); Software design","Schön, E.-M.; University of SevilleSpain; email: eva.schoen@iwt2.org",,"Elsevier B.V.",09205489,,CSTIE,,"English","Comput Stand Interfaces",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989237210

Studies show a steady growth of this sector and, for increases the competitive advantages, these organizations come to use tools and business strategy methods in their decision makings. These methods can contribute to increased competitiveness when they are supported by a Performance Measurement System (PMS). PMS measures the results through performance indicators, providing more accurate controls over the decision-making processes, as an example, when actions involve internal and external environment aspects, such as Cost Measurement, Quality and Stakeholders evaluate and satisfaction.

The interest on this approach has rapidly risen in both academic and industry circles. However, despite this interest, very limited research has focused on its implementation, and no research has investigated the barriers that hinder the success of such activity. This study investigates the Green Lean implementation barriers and their contextual relationships and effects on the integration and deployment of this approach. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR), Interpretative Structural Modelling and fuzzy Matriced’ Impacts Croise’s Multiplication Appliqée a UN Classement (MICMAC) analyses were carried out. Fifteen barriers were extracted from the SLR and then validated in consultation with industry and academic experts. The Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) method was used to understand the relationship between the fifteen barriers and to develop a hierarchical model of these. The different barriers were classified into ‘linkage’ and ‘dependent’ barriers by using MICMAC analysis. The results suggested that all the identified barriers play an important role, and hence can equally act as a significant hurdle to the implementation of Green Lean projects. This study can help managers and policy-makers in better understanding these barriers. Thus, they can be assisted in managing and prioritising barriers towards the successful implementation of Green Lean initiatives for better financial and environmental performance. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor and Francis Group.","Barriers; Green lean; Interpretive structural modelling (ISM); MICMAC analysis; Systematic literature review (SLR)","Environmental management; Hierarchical systems; Barriers; Green lean; Interpretive structural modelling (ISM); MICMAC analysis; Systematic literature review (SLR); Sustainable development","Cherrafi, A.; Cadi Ayyad UniversityMorocco; email: anass.charrafi@ced.uca.ma",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",09537287,,PPCOE,,"English","Prod Plann Control",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018282214

The objective of this research was to identify disinvestment initiatives in Latin American countries (LAC). Methods: First, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted. In February 2015, MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and LILACS were searched for relevant journal articles, including terms related to disinvestment, reallocation, obsolete technologies, and Latin America. Additionally, a manual search of documents from Latin American health technology assessment agencies was performed. Second, an online questionnaire was sent to experts in LAC to assess whether unpublished real-life disinvestment initiatives exist. Questionnaire results were collected in September 2015. Results: From the SLR, 350 records were selected for screening following de-duplication and eleven articles fulfilled inclusion criteria. Only two of these reported information on initiatives potentially identifiable as disinvestment-investment activities in Brazil and Peru. Nine respondents completed the questionnaire, and four reported that disinvestment initiatives had been conducted in their respective organizations in Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. This lack of agreement between the SLR and the questionnaire responses shows that disinvestment initiatives are ongoing, despite being under reported. Conclusions: Many challenges need to be overcome for a disinvestment initiative to be successful, and sharing particular experiences with the international community would increase the chances of positive outcomes. The present study highlights the need for publication of such experiences in LAC. © Cambridge University Press 2017.","Disinvestment; Health technology assessment; Latin America; Reassessment; Review","Health care; Reviews; Surveys; Disinvestment; Health technology assessments; International community; Latin America; Long-term sustainability; Reassessment; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Investments; Argentina; biomedical technology assessment; Brazil; Cochrane Library; Embase; female; human; information processing; investment; male; Medline; Mexico; organization; Peru; publication; questionnaire; systematic review; economics; evidence based practice; health care delivery; medical technology; South and Central America; Biomedical Technology; Evidence-Based Practice; Health Services Accessibility; Latin America",,,"Cambridge University Press",02664623,,IJTCE,"28956521","English","Int.

The execution of SCM activities as well as interactions among participants in the chains generates lots of information which can be analysed using qualitative methods. A common methodological problem in such analyses is how to move beyond specific linguistic material to generalisations. One method suited for this is centring resonance analysis (CRA), which allows the synthesis of texts into smaller categories. This article discusses the contributions and potential future use of CRA in SCM field by performing a systematic literature review in studies that adopted this technique. Results showed that CRA has been adopted in SCM since 2010 in order to analyse documents that vary from training materials and corporate social reports to interviews and software documentation. A characterisation of methods applied in conjunction with CRA is also provided.

However, this is a time-consuming and tedious activity, as it involves reading a large volume of material. Besides, several abstracts are sometimes not well-written. In this scenario, improving an abstract has been a concern, including the adoption of graphical abstracts. However, there is a lack of works that provide evidence about the relevance of using graphical abstracts to select studies within secondary studies. Objective: The objective of this paper is to analyze whether graphical abstracts based on Concept Maps (CM) could support selection of candidate primary st udies in SLR and MS.

The research question is to what extent PM systems (PMS) in academic literature and in industry are applicable in automotive logistics. Design/methodology/approach - The authors use a combination of a systematic literature review (SLR) and an industry survey. The SLR is used to identify literature on design aspects for PMS and current PMS reported in academic literature. The survey adds an industry perspective and is used to validate the design aspects found in literature. The synthesis aims to deliver both, current research gaps and needs in industry. Findings - The findings from SLR indicate, there is a broad base of literature regarding design aspects for PMS. Literature on PMS in context of automotive logistics is nevertheless rare. The industry survey leads to the conclusion that conformity with design aspects from literature increases added value of PMS. Nevertheless, current PMS show improvement needs in automotive context. Academic literature lacks detailed process orientation, transparency and is seen as too high level to be helpful for practitioners. For systems in industry, the SC perspective can be improved. In addition, applicability for continuous improvement is identified as research need in industry and literature. Research limitations/implications - Due to the selected survey approach, additional research is required to obtain more generalizable results. To increase reliability and validity, a selection of the findings should be further analyzed, e.g. by focusing on regions outside Western Europe or a more in depth analysis of selected aspects. In addition insights into selected research topics highlighted in the paper should be assessed in detail by applying different methodologies (e.g. case studies) to validate the findings. Originality/value - The findings add to the research on PMS. Latest academic literature is reviewed. The findings are combined with an industry perspective. The combination of SLR and a broad survey enables us to draw conclusions which are relevant for researchers and practitioners alike. Where academic research should focus more on the practical applicability, industry can benefit from the findings by integrating a more holistic perspective into their PMS, especially with a SC wide evaluation. © 2017 Sabet, Yazdani, De Leeuw.","Automotive; Logistics; Performance management; Performance measurement system; Supply chain; Supply chain management",,"Dörnhöfer, M.; Lehrstuhl für Fördertechnik Materialfluss Logistik, Technische Universität MünchenGermany; email: m.doernhoefer@gmx.de",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09574093,,,,"English","Int.

Nevertheless, less than 50 percent of projects implemented using Agile methods are considered successful, and selecting the wrong Agile method is one of the reasons for project failure. Selecting the most appropriate Agile method is a challenging task because there are so many to choose from. In addition, potential adopters believe that migrating to an Agile method involves taking a drastic risk. Therefore, to assist project managers and other decision makers, this study aims to identify the key factors that should be considered when selecting an appropriate Agile method. A systematic literature review was performed to elicit these factors in an unbiased manner, and then content analysis was used to analyze the resultant data. It was found that the nature of the project, development team skills, project constraints, customer involvement and organizational culture are the key factors that should guide decision makers in the selection of an appropriate Agile method based on the value these factors have for different organizations and/or different projects.","Agile method selection; Factors of selecting Agile methods; SLR",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

SNA seeks to uncover two different types of patterns; the first one to collect the actors who are closely associated to one another and the other one is to identify the sets of actors who are associated in the total social network in similar behavior. SNA adapts certain metrics from Graph Theory to identify the patterns and influential information in the huge social network. Various metrics from Graph Theory are used in many domains like Psychology, Sociology, and Social Science etc. The objective of the current research work is to adapt the SNA metrics and apply them in literature review context and draw meaningful inferences from the literatures reviewed. Literature review is a pioneer activity for any academic research. The traditional way of reviews narrating the literature in a comprehensive manner and describe or summarize the findings from the research works, but often failed to express insights and hypothesis/relationships. With the massive growth in internet resources, availability of research works online for any research topic is plenty; this creates more difficulty in spotting a research gap for future research activities. To facilitate research works and create quantitative parameters from the existing research works, the paper elaborates a SNA based metrics for doing systematic literature review. This paper discusses a procedure for literature data collection, constructing the literature data into structured data and using this input for SNA based analysis, and finally, introduces SNA metrics like degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, eccentricity centrality, eigen vector centrality, average shortest path, connected component, graph density and modularity and their correspondence with review of literatures.

This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) on the role of the results of Big Data Analytics in corporate decisions. Initially, 1652 papers were identified from various sources. Filtering through the 5-step process, 20 relevant studies were selected for analysis in this SLR. The findings of this study are fourfold in the area of: (a) usage of the results of Big Data Analytics in corporate decision-making; (b) the types of business functions where analytics has been fruitfully utilised; (c) the impact of analytics on decision-making; and (d) the impediments to using Big Data Analytics in corporate decision-making. Also, on the management front, two important issues identified are: (i) aligning data-driven decision-making with business strategy and (ii) collaboration across business functions for effective flow of Big Data and information. On the technical front, big data present some challenges due to the lack of tools to process such properties of Big Data as variety, veracity, volume, and velocity. We observe from this analysis that, thus far, little scientific research has focused on understanding how to address the analytics results in corporate decision-making.

Our aim was to develop a consensus definition for SSc skin ulcers based on the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) for skin ulcer definitions and expert opinion; and to evaluate its face validity, reliability and feasibility. Methods: SLR for skin ulcer definitions was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane library for articles published from inception to January 1 st ,2016. SSc experts were to discuss the definition categories and vote for the relevant terms. Reliability of the definition was tested in a second expert meeting, seven SSc experts evaluated 7 SSc patients with skin lesions twice. Face validity and feasibility were evaluated by sending out case report forms (CRFs) to four SSc experts, who were each asked to use the definition in five patients. Results: A total of 3464 abstracts and titles were screened, and 446 articles were fully evaluated. of these, 66 met eligibility criteria and skin ulcer definitions were extracted. SSc experts discussed, refined, and voted on the consensus definition using nominal process. Kappa for inter-rater agreement was 0.51 and for intra-rater agreement was 0.90. The mean time to decide if the lesion is an ulcer was 7.4 seconds. All investigators endorsed the face validity of the new definition in the CRFs. Conclusions: Using an SLR and a nominal technique, we developed a preliminary consensus-based definition of SSc skin ulcers.

Methods: The expert committee defined research questions concerning non-pharmacological interventions, patient information and education, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, glucocorticoid (GC) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) use, as well as on disease monitoring. The SLR included articles published after the last EULAR SLR until November 2015 found in the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane databases and abstracts from the 2014 and 2015 American College of Rheumatology and EULAR conferences. Results: Exercise programmes may improve pain and physical function in patients with EA. Patients with EA treated within the first 3 months of symptoms have better clinical and radiological outcomes than those treated beyond 3 months. The clinical and radiological efficacy of GCs is confirmed, with similar efficacy of oral and parenteral administrations. Long-term data raise concerns regarding cardiovascular safety when using GCs. Step-up DMARD therapy is as effective as intensive DMARD therapy 'ab initio' for the long-term outcome of EA. Short-term superiority of intensive therapy with bDMARDs is not maintained on withdrawal of bDMARD. Patients with early psoriatic arthritis have better skin and joint outcomes when tight control is used compared to standard care. Conclusions: The findings confirm the beneficial effect of exercise programmes and the importance of early drug therapy and tight control. They support the use of methotrexate and GCs as first-line drugs, although the long-term use of GCs raises safety concerns.",,"adalimumab; certolizumab pegol; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; glucocorticoid; infliximab; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; prednisone; salazosulfapyridine; triamcinolone; arthritis; Article; clinical outcome; clinical trial (topic); drug efficacy; drug safety; early arthritis; human; intensive care; kinesiotherapy; outcome assessment; pain; patient education; patient information; physical activity; psoriatic arthritis; remission; symptom; systematic review; treatment failure","Daien, C.I.; Rheumatology department, Lapeyronie Hospital, Montpellier UniversityFrance; email: cidaien@gmail.com",,"BMJ Publishing Group",20565933,,,,"English","RMD Open",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009121708

Greater understanding of how to best use SMS as a means to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes will foster innovation in research and provide an opportunity to progress as a public health community. Purpose: The purposes of this systematic review are 2-fold: (1) to provide insight on the most used mobile phone SMS practices and characteristics in hypertension (HTN) outcome-focused publications and (2) to critically evaluate empirical evidence associated with SMS utilization and BP outcomes. Methods: Two independent systematic literature searches were completed. The final selected studies each then underwent data extraction and quality-rating assessment, followed by an evaluation for a meta-analysis to measure mean difference of the change in BP. Results: A total of 6 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Feasibility assessment for a meta-analysis was found unfavorable because of the variation among studies. Short Message Service interventions focused on BP management were most effective in studies featuring 2-way communication and individual patient-tailored content, and guided by evidence-based HTN management practices. Implications: Short Message Service interventions for HTN management were supported through evidence provided by the studies reviewed. Short Message Service holds strong potential to bring greater innovation to HTN management and care, especially in racial/ethnic minority populations that face psychosocial and structural barriers in healthcare access and utilization.

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of tofacitinib, an oral Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), as monotherapy and combined with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) versus biological DMARDs (bDMARDs) and other novel DMARDs for second-line moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients by means of a systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA). Methods. MEDLINE®, EMBASE®, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched to identify randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published between 1990 and March 2015. Efficacy data based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria, improvements in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at 6 months, and discontinuation rates due to adverse events were analyzed by means of Bayesian NMAs. Results. 45 RCTs were identified, the majority of which demonstrated a low risk of bias. Tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily (BID) and 10 mg BID monotherapy exhibited comparable efficacy and discontinuation rates due to adverse events versus other monotherapies. Tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID + DMARDs or methotrexate (MTX) were mostly comparable to other combination therapies in terms of efficacy and discontinuation due to adverse events. Conclusion.

The first part of the systematic literature review (SLR) involved a search for studies investigating the recognition and referral of EA. The second part involved a search for studies to identify the place of laboratory and imaging tests in establishing a diagnosis and a prognosis in patients with EA. Results: Regarding the issue of referral of patients with EA (1643 hits), 4 studies were included. These studies were in support of early referral for patients with EA. Regarding the issue of diagnosis and prognosis of patients with EA (11 435 hits), 88 studies were included, evaluating mainly the value of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anticitrullinated-peptide antibodies (ACPAs). Sensitivity of these antibodies for a RA diagnosis in patients with EA was moderate (40-80%). Specificity was higher, notably for ACPAs (frequently >80%). ACPAs also showed better prognostic performance than RF (negative predictive values around 80%). We confirmed that structural damage on baseline X-rays is predictive of further radiographic progression in patients with EA. Regarding other imaging modalities, data are sparse.

Multiple systematic reviews have concluded that some SMS-based interventions are effective at improving antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and they are hypothesized to improve retention in care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the costeffectiveness of SMS-based adherence interventions and explore the added value of retention benefits. Methods: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of weekly SMS interventions compared to standard care among HIV+ individuals initiating ART for the first time in Kenya. We used an individual level micro-simulation model populated with data from two SMSintervention trials, an East-African HIV+ cohort and published literature. We estimated average quality adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime HIV-related costs from a healthcare perspective. We explored a wide range of scenarios and assumptions in one-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses. Results: We found that SMS-based adherence interventions were cost-effective by WHO standards, with an incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1,037/QALY. In the secondary analysis, potential retention benefits improved the cost-effectiveness of SMS intervention (ICER=$864/QALY). In multivariate sensitivity analyses, the interventions remained cost-effective in most analyses, but the ICER was highly sensitive to intervention costs, effectiveness and average cohort CD4 count at ART initiation. SMS interventions remained cost-effective in a test and treat scenario where individuals were assumed to initiate ART upon HIV detection. Conclusions: Effective SMS interventions would likely increase the efficiency of ART programs by improving HIV treatment outcomes at relatively low costs, and they could facilitate achievement of the UNAIDS goal of 90% viral suppression among those on ART by 2020. © 2017 the Author(s).","Cost-effectiveness; Drug adherence; HIV; Implementation science; MHealth; Mobile phone; SMS","antiretrovirus agent; efavirenz; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; female; health care; health care cost; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Kenya; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; patient compliance; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; secondary analysis; simulation; text messaging; virus load; cost benefit analysis; economics; HIV Infections; text messaging; Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Kenya; Male; Medication Adherence; Text Messaging","Patel, A.R.; University of British Columbia, #575 - 828 W10th St., Canada; email: anikpa@mail.ubc.ca",,"Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",00257974,,MEDIA,"28207516","English","Medicine",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013664385

The importance of BPM to Business Process Management can be justified by the serious problems, which may arise in the latter, if the former is not conducted correctly. This can take place, inter alia, when an inappropriate choice of a BPM formalism for a given BPM context has been made. Such an improper choice is due not only to the availability of a huge number of BPM formalisms but also to the lack of guidelines assisting in the selection process. Our aim in this paper, is to propose a context-aware roadmap with associated methodological guidelines underpinning the selection of the appropriate BPM formalism. To this end, a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies on BPM formalisms quality has been undertaken.

Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions. In doing so, systematically analysing and synthesizing the extant research published on BD and BDA area. More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: Q1 – What are the different types of BD challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and Q2 – What are the different types of BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome BD challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the BDA research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of BD strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant BD research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the BDA in technology and organizational resource management discipline. © 2016 The Authors","Big Data; Big Data Analytics; Challenges; Methods; Systematic literature review",,"Sivarajah, U.; Brunel University London, College of Business, Arts and Social Sciences, Brunel Business SchoolUnited Kingdom; email: Sankar.Sivarajah@brunel.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Inc.",01482963,,JBRED,,"English","J.

These definitions do not however provide equal prominence for the data governance within the cloud computing technology context. As such, this deficit calls for in-depth understanding of data governance and cloud Computing. This trend contributes to changes in data governance strategy in the organisation, such as the organisation's structure and regulations, people, technology, process, roles and responsibilities. This is one of the great challenges facing organizations today when they move their data to Cloud Computing environments, particularly how Cloud technology affects data governance. The authors' general observation reveals that the area of data governance in general is under researched and not widely practiced by organisations, let alone when it is concerned with cloud computing, where research is really in its infancy and far from reaching maturity.

This article ad-dresses IS security policy violations in organizational settings, and conceptual-izes and problematizes IS security violations by employees of organizations from a paradox perspective. Background: The paradox is that internal employees are increasingly being perceived as more of a threat to the security of organizational systems than outsiders. The notion of paradox is exemplified in four organizational contexts of: belonging paradox, learning paradox, organizing paradox and performing paradox. Methodology: A qualitative conceptual framework exemplifying how IS security violations oc-cur as paradoxes in context to these four areas is presented at the end of this article. Contribution: The article contributes to IS security management practice and suggests how IS security managers should be positioned to understand violations in light of this paradox perspective. Findings: The employee generally in the process of carrying out ordinary activities using computing technology exemplifies unique tensions (or paradoxes in belonging, learning, organizing and performing) and these tensions would generally tend to lead to policy violations when an imbalance occurs. Recommendations for Practitioners: IS security managers must be sensitive to employees tensions. Future Research: A quantitative study, where statistical analysis could be applied to generalize findings, could be useful.","Information security; Paradox; Security policies; Systematic literature review (SLR); Violations","Human resource management; Information systems; Managers; Security of data; Security systems; Information systems security; Information systems security policies; Organizational context; Organizational setting; Paradox; Security policy; Systematic literature review (SLR); Violations; Information use","Njenga, K.; Department of Applied Information Systems, University of JohannesburgSouth Africa; email: knjenga@uj.ac.za",,"Informing Science Institute",15551229,,,,"English","Interdiscip.

Although there is evidence that these common mental health problems are preventable and treatable in the workplace, uptake of psychological treatments among the working population is low. One way to address this may be the delivery of occupational digital mental health interventions. While there is convincing evidence for delivering digital psychological interventions within a health and community context, there is no systematic review or meta-analysis of these interventions in an occupational setting. Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the effectiveness of occupational digital mental health interventions in enhancing employee psychological well-being and increasing work effectiveness and to identify intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using Cochrane guidelines. Papers published from January 2000 to May 2016 were searched in the PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane databases, as well as the databases of the researchers and relevant websites. Unpublished data was sought using the Conference Proceedings Citation Index and the Clinical Trials and International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) research registers. A meta-analysis was conducted by applying a random-effects model to assess the pooled effect size for psychological well-being and the work effectiveness outcomes. A positive deviance approach was used to identify those intervention features associated with the highest rates of engagement and adherence. Results: In total, 21 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the search criteria. Occupational digital mental health interventions had a statistically significant effect post intervention on both psychological well-being (g=0.37, 95% CI 0.23-0.50) and work effectiveness (g=0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.41) compared with the control condition. No statistically significant differences were found on either outcome between studies using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approaches (as defined by the authors) compared with other psychological approaches, offering guidance compared with self-guidance, or recruiting from a targeted workplace population compared with a universal workplace population. In-depth analysis of the interventions identified by the positive deviance approach suggests that interventions that offer guidance are delivered over a shorter time frame (6 to 7 weeks), utilize secondary modalities for delivering the interventions and engaging users (ie, emails and text messages [short message service, SMS]), and use elements of persuasive technology (ie, self-monitoring and tailoring), which may achieve greater engagement and adherence. Conclusions: This review provides evidence that occupational digital mental health interventions can improve workers' psychological well-being and increase work effectiveness. It identifies intervention characteristics that may increase engagement. Recommendations are made for future research, practice, and intervention development.","Adherence; Engagement; Internet; Meta-analysis; Psychological interventions; Stress; Systematic review; Wellbeing; Workplace","cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; e-mail; effect size; employee; human; Internet; Medline; meta analysis; model; practice guideline; psychological well-being; PsycINFO; randomized controlled trial; ScienceDirect; scientist; self monitoring; stress; systematic review; worker; workplace; Internet; mental health; occupational health; psychology; standards; utilization; workplace; Humans; Internet; Mental Health; Occupational Health; Workplace","Carolan, S.; School of Psychology, University of SussexUnited Kingdom; email: sc587@sussex.ac.uk",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,"28747293","English","J.

However, there are not many papers that study this issue holistically and uncover the current state of this integration. Objective: This study sets out to answer the following research question: What is the current state of integration between agile processes and usability techniques? Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS). A SMS is a form of systematic literature review that aims to identify and classify the research papers published about a specified issue. Results: We retrieved a total of 31 primary studies, suggesting that the agile development community is starting to adopt some usability techniques in its development projects. Most of the human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques that the ASDP is adopting are techniques related to requirements engineering, especially techniques for requirements elicitation and analysis. Judging by the increase in the number of publications over the last decade, the integration of HCI activities and techniques into the ASDP is an issue of notable interest. Conclusions: There are few papers that study the literature holistically and report the current state of usability in the ASDP. Additionally, the literature does not contain a general, formal and systematic proposal to help agile development teams adopt usability techniques in their development projects. © 2016 IEEE.","Agile Software Development; Usability; Usability Techniques; User-centred Design","Data visualization; Human computer interaction; Integration; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; Usability engineering; User centered design; Agile software development; Agile software development process; Human computer interaction (HCI); Requirements elicitation; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Usability; Usability techniques; Software design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509011476,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The results of this process are known to have key impact on the results of the project. As known from the experience in other fields and disciplines, visualization can potentially provide more insights into data, information and knowledge studied. While research in the area of information visualization and its application to software engineering has rapidly increased over the last decade, there is only a limited amount of studies addressing the usage and impact of visualization techniques for RE activities. In this paper, we report on the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) related to RE visualization. Extending the established SLR process by the usage of grounded theory for the encoding of papers, we synthesize 18 usage patterns. Even though there are punctual applications, there is a clear deficit on a holistic perspective across the different RE activities. As another conclusion, we derive the clear need for more research on visualization support in particular for tackling requirements uncertainty, requirements verification, and modeling, as well as non-functional requirements (NFRs). © 2016 IEEE.",,"Application programs; Information systems; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; Uncertainty analysis; Visualization; Holistic perspectives; Information visualization; Non-functional requirements; Requirements uncertainties; Requirements verification; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Visualization technique; Data visualization",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509041213,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

MBT gains interest in industry and academia due to its provision of systematic, automated, and comprehensive testing. Researchers have successfully applied search-based techniques (SBTs) by automating the search for an optimal set of test cases at reasonable cost compared to other more expensive techniques. Thus, there is a recent surge toward the applications of SBTs for MBT because the generated test cases are optimal and have low computational cost. However, successful, future SBTs for MBT applications demand deep insight into its existing experimental applications that underlines stringent issues and challenges, which is lacking in the literature. Objective The objective of this study is to comprehensively analyze the current state-of-the-art of the experimental applications of SBTs for MBT and present the limitations of the current literature to direct future research. Method We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using 72 experimental papers from six data sources. We proposed a taxonomy based on the literature to categorize the characteristics of the current applications. Results The results indicate that the majority of the existing applications of SBTs for MBT focus on functional and structural coverage purposes, as opposed to stress testing, regression testing and graphical user interface (GUI) testing. We found research gaps in the existing applications in five areas: applying multi-objective SBTs, proposing hybrid techniques, handling complex constraints, addressing data and requirement-based adequacy criteria, and adapting landscape visualization. Only twelve studies proposed and empirically evaluated the SBTs for complex systems in MBT. Conclusion This extensive systematic analysis of the existing literature based on the proposed taxonomy enables to assist researchers in exploring the existing research efforts and reveal the limitations that need additional investigation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Model-based testing; Search-based techniques; Software testing; Systematic literature review; Taxonomy; Test case generation","Data visualization; Graphical user interfaces; Model checking; Taxonomies; Experimental application; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Landscape visualization; Model based testing; Search-based; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Test case generation; Software testing","Saeed, A.; Department of Software Engineering, Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of MalayaMalaysia; email: aneesa.saeed@siswa.um.edu.my",,"Elsevier Ltd",15684946,,,,"English","Appl.

One of the major reasons for GSD project failure is that a number of organizations endorse global development prior to understanding project management challenges for the global activity. Objective The objective of this paper is to identify the challenges, from the client and vendor perspectives, which can undermine the successful management of GSD projects. Method We followed a two-phase approach: we first identified the challenges via a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and then the identified challenges were validated using a questionnaire-based survey. Results Through both approaches, we identified 19 challenges important to the success of GSD project management. A comparison of the challenges identified in client and vendor organizations indicates that there are more similarities than differences between the challenges. Our results show a positive correlation between the ranks obtained from the SLR and the questionnaire ((rs(19) = 0.102), p = 0.679). The results of t-test (i.e., t = 0.299, p = 0.768 &gt; 0.05) show that there is no significant difference between the findings of SLR and questionnaire. Conclusions GSD organizations should try to address the identified challenges when managing their global software development activities to increase the probability of project success. © 2016","Challenges and barriers; Empirical study; Global software development; Software project management; Systematic literature review","Project management; Societies and institutions; Surveys; Challenges and barriers; Empirical studies; Global software development; Software project management; Systematic literature review; Software design","Niazi, M.; Department of Information and Computer Science, King Fahd University of Petroleum and MineralsSaudi Arabia; email: mkniazi@kfupm.edu.sa",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982131063

Due to the scale, complexity, and heterogeneity of SoS, determining compliance with their requirements is challenging, despite the range of existing monitoring approaches. The fragmented research landscape and the diversity of existing approaches, however, make it hard to understand and analyze existing research regarding its suitability for SoS. Objective The aims of this paper are thus to systematically identify, describe, and classify existing approaches for requirements-based monitoring of software systems at runtime. Specifically, we (i) analyze the characteristics and application areas of monitoring approaches proposed in different domains, we (ii) systematically identify frameworks supporting requirements monitoring, and finally (iii) analyze their support for requirements monitoring in SoS. Method We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify existing monitoring approaches and to classify their key characteristics and application areas. Based on this analysis we selected requirements monitoring frameworks, following a definition by Robinson, and analyzed them regarding their support for requirements monitoring in SoS. Results We identified 330 publications, which we used to produce a comprehensive overview of the landscape of requirements monitoring approaches. We analyzed these publications regarding their support for Robinson's requirements monitoring layers, resulting in 37 identified frameworks. We investigated how well these frameworks support requirements monitoring in SoS. Conclusions We conclude that most existing approaches are restricted to certain kinds of checks, particular types of events and data, and mostly also limited to one particular architectural style and technology. This lack of flexibility makes their application in an SoS context difficult. Also, systematic and automated variability management is still missing. Regarding their evaluation, many existing frameworks focus on measuring the performance overhead, while only few frameworks have been assessed in cases studies with real-world systems. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Requirements monitoring; Systematic literature review; Systems of systems","Computer software; System of systems; Systems engineering; Architectural style; Key characteristics; Requirements monitoring; Support requirements; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systems of systems; Variability management; Monitoring","Vierhauser, M.; Christian Doppler Laboratory MEVSS, Institute for Software Systems Engineering, Johannes Kepler University LinzAustria; email: michael.vierhauser@jku.at",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984972165

A successful collaboration, however, depends on certain trustworthy behaviors partner exhibit. To that end, understanding aspects constituting behavioral uncertainty and mechanisms by which such aspects affect partner trust is a necessary. This necessity counts on emergent behavioral trust uncertainties, constituted by partner’s actions and interactions occurring during collaboration. While this is a necessary requirement, most of the studies in the literature lack to take into account the influence of behavioral uncertainty on collaboration and partner trust. To that effect, this paper uncovers outlined limitation by establishing behavioral factors influencing partner trust in operational stage of logistics collaboration. To accomplish this objective, a systematic literature review (SLR) is deployed to consolidate research domains of logistics, supply chain, collaboration, and trust. SLR proceeds by defining a review protocol, followed by a search process conducted in 5 databases using 20 search terms on articles published between 2001 and 2015 inclusively. Among findings this SLR has revealed are four behavioral factors and thirteen criteria proposed to affect partner trust. Additionally, these factors constitute success and measurable criteria needed for empirical investigation which may employ experimental and/or case-study methods. Moreover, synthesized factors extend further an understanding of behavioral trust in ad hoc collaborative networks, a large part of which being supported by networks of humans and computers. © 2016, The Author(s).","Behavioral trust; Logistics collaboration; Partner trust; Resource sharing; Trust",,"Daudi, M.; International Graduate School for Dynamics in Logistics (IGS), University of Bremen, c/o BIBA GmbH, Hochschulring 20, Germany; email: mdaudi@uni-bremen.de",,"Springer Verlag",1865035X,,,,"English","Logist.

Organizations are expected to implement appropriate practices to address knowledge-sharing challenges in GSD. With the growing literature on GSD and its widespread adoption, it is important to build a body of knowledge to support future research and effective knowledge sharing practices. Objective We aimed at systematically identifying and synthesizing knowledge sharing challenges and practices. We also intended to classify the recurrent challenges and most frequently reported practices in different contextual settings. Method We used Systematic Literature Review (SLR) for reviewing 61 primary studies that were selected after searching the GSD literature published over the last 14 years (2000–September 2014). We applied thematic analysis method for analysing the data extracted from the reviewed primary studies. Results Our findings revealed that knowledge sharing challenges and practices in GSD could be classified in 6 main themes: management, team structure, work processes/practices, team cognition, social attributes and technology. In regard to contextual settings, we found empirical studies were mainly conducted in an offshore outsourcing collaboration model distributed between two sites. Most of the studied organizations were large enterprises. Many of the studies did not report any information for several contextual attributes that made it difficult to analyse the reported challenges and practices with respect to their respective contexts. Conclusion We can conclude: (a) there is a higher tendency among researchers to report practices than challenges of knowledge sharing in GSD. (b) Given our analysis, most of the reported knowledge sharing challenges and practices fall under the theme of “work practices”. (c) The technology related knowledge-sharing challenges are the least reported; we discussed the available technologies for supporting knowledge sharing needs in GSD. (d) The organizational contextual information is missing from a large number of studies; hence, it was not possible to investigate the potential relations between knowledge sharing challenges/practices and the contextual attributes of GSD teams. We assert the need of exploring knowledge sharing in the context of small/medium sized organizations to avoid the risk of findings being biased by specific empirical setting (e.g., large enterprises distributed between US and India). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Empirical software engineering; Global software development (GSD); Knowledge management (KM); Knowledge sharing; Systematic literature review (SLR)","Human resource management; Offshore oil well production; Software design; Collaboration models; Contextual information; Empirical Software Engineering; Global software development; Knowledge-sharing; Offshore Outsourcing; Supporting knowledge; Systematic literature review (SLR); Knowledge management","Zahedi, M.; IT University of Copenhagen, Rued Langgaards Vej 7, Denmark; email: mzah@itu.dk",,"Elsevier Ltd",02684012,,IJMAE,,"English","Int J Inf Manage",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977627599

In an ideal world, all knowledge used in industry, education and research should be based on high-quality evidence. Since no decision should be made based on a single study, secondary studies become essential in presenting the evidence. According to our search, over 101 secondary studies have been published in the area of software testing since 1994. With this high number of secondary studies, it is important to conduct a review in this area to provide an overview of the research landscape in this area. Objective The goal of this study is to systematically map (classify) the secondary studies in software testing. We propose that tertiary studies can serve as summarizing indexes which facilitate finding the most relevant information from secondary studies and thus supporting evidence-based decision making in any given area of software engineering. Our research questions (RQs) investigate: (1) Software-testing-specific areas, (2) Types of RQs investigated, (3) Numbers and Trends, and (4) Citations of the secondary studies. Method To conduct the tertiary study, we use the systematic-mapping approach. Additionally, we contrast the testing topics to the number of Google hits to address a general popularity of a testing topic and study the most popular papers in terms of citations. We furthermore demonstrate the practicality and usefulness of our results by mapping them to ISTQB foundation syllabus and to SWEBOK to provide implications for practitioners, testing educators, and researchers. Results After a systematic search and voting process, our study pool included 101 secondary studies in the area of software testing between 1994 and 2015. Among our results are the following: (1) In terms of number of secondary studies, model-based approach is the most popular testing method, web services are the most popular system under test (SUT), while regression testing is the most popular testing phase; (2) The quality of secondary studies, as measured by a criteria set established in the community, is slowly increasing as the years go by; and (3) Analysis of research questions, raised and studied in the pool of secondary studies, showed that there is a lack of ‘causality’ and ‘relationship’ type of research questions, a situation which needs to be improved if we, as a community, want to advance as a scientific field. (4) Among secondary studies, we found that regular surveys receive significantly more citations than SMs (p = 0.009) and SLRs (p = 0.014). Conclusion Despite the large number of secondary studies, we found that many important areas of software testing currently lack secondary studies, e.g., test management, role of product risk in testing, human factors in software testing, beta-testing (A/B-testing), exploratory testing, testability, test stopping criteria, and test-environment development. Having secondary studies in those areas is important for satisfying industrial and educational needs in software testing. On the other hand, education material of ISTQB foundation syllabus and SWEBOK could benefit from the inclusion of the latest research topics, namely search-based testing, use of cloud-computing for testing and symbolic execution. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Secondary studies; Software testing; Surveys; Systematic literature reviews; Systematic mapping; Tertiary study","Decision making; Mapping; Surveying; Surveys; Testing; Web services; Education and researches; Evidence- based decisions; Industrial practitioners; Search-based testing; Secondary studies; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Tertiary study; Software testing","Garousi, V.; Software Engineering Research Group, Department of Computer Engineering, Hacettepe UniversityTurkey; email: vgarousi@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987968030

However, the RE community still lacks a comprehensive understanding of how ontologies are used in RE process. Thus, the main objective of this work is to investigate and better understand how ontologies support RE as well as identify to what extent they have been applied to this field. In order to meet our goal, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the primary studies on the use of ontologies in RE, following a predefined review protocol. We then identified the main RE phases addressed, the requirements modelling styles that have been used in conjunction with ontologies, the types of requirements that have been supported by the use of ontologies and the ontology languages that have been adopted. We also examined the types of contributions reported and looked for evidences of the benefits of ontology-driven RE. In summary, the main findings of this work are: (1) there are empirical evidences of the benefits of using ontologies in RE activities both in industry and academy, specially for reducing ambiguity, inconsistency and incompleteness of requirements; (2) the majority of studies only partially address the RE process; (3) there is a great diversity of RE modelling styles supported by ontologies; (4) most studies addressed only functional requirements; (5) several studies describe the use/development of tools to support different types of ontology-driven RE approaches; (6) about half of the studies followed W3C recommendations on ontology-related languages; and (7) a great variety of RE ontologies were identified; nevertheless, none of them has been broadly adopted by the community. Finally, we conclude this work by showing several promising research opportunities that are quite important and interesting but underexplored in current research and practice. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.","Ontologies; Requirements engineering; Systematic literature review","Computational linguistics; Modeling languages; Ontology; Requirements engineering; Functional requirement; Ontology language; Requirements modelling; Research opportunities; Support requirements; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Engineering research","Dermeval, D.; Systems and Computing Department, Federal University of Campina GrandeBrazil; email: diegodermeval@copin.ufcg.edu.br",,"Springer International Publishing",09473602,,,,"English","Requir.

Mobile technology-based interventions provide a particularly promising avenue for the widespread and cost-effective delivery of treatment that is accessible, affordable, individualized, and destigmatized to both alcohol-dependent and nondependent individuals. Aims: The present review sought to summarize the current literature on mobile technology-based interventions among adult users of alcohol and determine the efficacy of such interventions. Methods: Five databases were searched in December 2015 (Jan. 2004-Dec. 2015). Inclusion criteria were: participants aged 18 or older, interventions delivered through mobile-technology, and outcome measurement of alcohol reduction/cessation. Findings: Eight studies met inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies reviewed found positive effects of the intervention, even though the interventions themselves varied in design, length, dosage, and target population, and were pilot or preliminary in nature. Conclusions: Findings from this review highlight the promising, yet preliminary state of research in this area. Studies with adequate power and valid design are necessary to evaluate the potential of mobile technology-based interventions on long-term alcohol behavior outcomes. Furthermore, future research should elucidate what the most effective length of time is for a mobile technology-based intervention, how often individuals should receive messages for maximum benefit, and determine the comparative effectiveness of mobile technology interventions with other efficacious interventions. © 2016.","Alcohol; Intervention; SMS; Substance use; Text messaging","adult; alcohol abstinence; alcohol consumption; alcohol use disorder; alcoholism; bibliographic database; cognitive behavioral therapy; comparative effectiveness; cost effectiveness analysis; emergency ward; follow up; human; intervention study; medical record; meta analysis; mobile application; mobile phone; outcome assessment; personal digital assistant; Review; smartphone; systematic review; text messaging; adolescent; aged; alcoholism; epidemiology; middle aged; mobile phone; point of care system; treatment outcome; utilization; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcoholism; Cell Phone; Epidemiologic Methods; Humans; Middle Aged; Point-of-Care Systems; Text Messaging; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","Fowler, L.A.; George Washington UniversityUnited States; email: lfowler@gwu.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",03064603,,ADBED,"27310031","English","Addict.

PHR users are able to manage their own health data and communicate with doctors in order to improve healthcare quality and efficiency. Mobile PHR (mPHR) applications for mobile devices have obtained an interesting market quota since the appearance of more powerful mobile devices. These devices allow users to gain access to applications that used to be available only for personal computers. This paper analyzes the functionalities of mobile PHRs that are specific to pregnancy monitoring. Methods A well-known Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol was used in the analysis process. A questionnaire was developed for this task, based on the rigorous study of scientific literature concerning pregnancy and applications available on the market, with 9 data items and 35 quality assessments. The data items contain calendars, pregnancy information, health habits, counters, diaries, mobile features, security, backup, configuration and architectural design. Results A total of 33 mPHRs for pregnancy monitoring, available for iOS and Android, were selected from Apple App store and Google Play store, respectively. The results show that none of the mPHRs selected met 100% of the functionalities analyzed in this paper. The highest score achieved was 77%, while the lowest was 17%. Conclusions In this paper, these features are discussed and possible paths for future development of similar applications are proposed, which may lead to a more efficient use of smartphone capabilities. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd","Functionality; Mobile health; Personal Health Record; Pregnancy monitoring","Commerce; Health care; Mobile devices; Obstetrics; Personal computers; Functionality; Health information technologies; Healthcare quality; Mobile health; Personal health record; Quality assessment; Scientific literature; Systematic literature review (SLR); Health; apple; electronic patient record; female; habit; human; market; monitoring; personal computer; pregnancy; quality control; questionnaire; scientific literature; smartphone; systematic review; medical record; mobile application; physiologic monitoring; pregnancy; Female; Health Records, Personal; Humans; Mobile Applications; Monitoring, Physiologic; Pregnancy","Bachiri, M.; Software Project Management research Team, ENSIAS, Mohammed V University in RabatMorocco; email: bachiri.mariam@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",01692607,,CMPBE,"27480737","English","Comput.

Here, we report 15 new observations of SLS during SLE and provide a systematic literature review. We studied the clinical, biological, functional and morphologic characteristics, the treatments used and their efficacy. Methods The inclusion criteria were all patients with SLE defined by the American College of Rheumatology criteria Hochberg (1997), associated with a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function tests. The exclusion criteria were all differential diagnoses of restrictive patterns, including obesity and pulmonary fibrosis. The patients were recruited from local databases through chest physicians, rheumatologists and internists. The data for the literature review were extracted from the Medline database using “shrinking lung syndrome” and “lupus” as key words. Results All 15 new cases were women with a median age at SLS onset of 27 years old (range 17–67 years). All of them complained of dyspnea and all but one of chest pain. The antibodies were similar to those found in SLE, although the anti-SS-A was positive in 10 of 13 cases. Thoracic imaging showed elevated hemidiaphragm (12/15) and/or basal atelectasia (8/15). All of the patients had an isolated restrictive pattern on PFT, with a median decrease > 50% of lung volume. All of the patients were treated, using corticosteroids (11/15), immunosuppressive drugs (8/15), beta-mimetics (2/15), physiotherapy (3/15) and/or colchicine (1/15). Improvement was described in 9 of 12 patients and stability in 3 of 12. We extracted 155 cases of SLE-associated SLS from the Medline database. The clinical, biological and functional parameters were similar to our cases. Clinical improvement was described in 48 of 52 cases (94%) and PFT improvement in 36 of 47 cases. Worsening occurred in 4 cases. Conclusion SLS is a rare SLE manifestation. Pain and parietal inflammation seem to play important pathogenic roles. Steroids and antalgics are the most commonly used therapies with good responses. There is no proof of efficacy with immunosuppressive drugs for this entity. Rituximab can be discussed after failure of corticosteroids, as well as antalgics, theophylline and beta-mimetics. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Corticosteroids; Immunosuppressive drugs; Outcomes; Shrinking lung syndrome; Systemic lupus erythematosus","antinuclear antibody; azathioprine; beta 2 mimetic; colchicine; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; DNA antibody; immunosuppressive agent; La antibody; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; ribonucleoprotein antibody; rituximab; Ro antibody; Sm antibody; theophylline; unclassified drug; immunosuppressive agent; alopecia; arthralgia; atelectasis; computer assisted tomography; corticosteroid therapy; coughing; diaphragm; disease association; dyspnea; echography; fever; follow up; glomerulonephritis; hemidiaphragm; human; immunosuppressive treatment; lung disease; lung fibrosis; lung function test; lung volume; multicenter study (topic); obesity; outcome assessment; pericardial effusion; physiotherapy; pleura effusion; pleura thickening; respiratory function; Review; shrinking lung syndrome; shrinking lung syndrome; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; thorax pain; thorax radiography; treatment response; adolescent; adult; aged; complication; female; immunology; Lung Diseases; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; middle aged; retrospective study; syndrome; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Lung Diseases; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Middle Aged; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Retrospective Studies; Syndrome; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult","Cohen-Aubart, F.; Service de Médecine Interne 2, Groupe Hospitalier Pitié-Salpêtrière, 47-83 Boulevard de l'Hôpital, France; email: fleur.cohen@psl.aphp.fr",,"Elsevier B.V.",15689972,,ARUEB,"27481038","English","Autoimmun.

This is due to characteristics of this type of systems, such as the high number of configurations and runtime adaptations. In this context, the characterisation of challenges for testing ASs may support the definition of suitable testing strategies. However, such characterisation is currently spread over several studies in the literature. Objective: analysing testing-related challenges for ASs which are described in the literature, and establishing a generic classification. Method: we extended a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of studies that address challenges for AS testing. By analysing the combined results (original and extended), we mapped descriptions found in individual studies, based on their similarities, in order to create a list of generic challenges. Results: a list of 12 generic challenges based on 34 specific ones described by several authors. Additionally, we analysed the relationship between the challenges and inherent properties of ASs. Conclusion: different terminology, varied levels of details and particular contexts (e.g. specific AS implementations) are recurring problems related to the characterisation of challenges for testing ASs. Generalisations such as the one proposed in this work may help researchers and practitioners do devise customised testing strategies that focus in recurring, inherent properties of ASs.

Typical post-natural disaster reconstruction (PDR) projects are different from routine construction projects due to certain additional challenges. Understanding the wide range of individuals and groups that have direct or indirect stakes, interests and expectations from a PDR project is vital for its success. However, research on PDR with special emphasis on stakeholders and their significance in success and sustainability of the projects is limited. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) to amalgamate and synthesise research in this area. It focuses on the identification of the stakeholders and significance of their engagement in PDR activities for a more sustainable and resilient built environment. Research papers published in peer reviewed academic journals from 2000 to 2014 were identified through three major research databases, using T/A/K search options. The selected research papers were reviewed and critically analysed to identify the stakeholders and mechanism of their identification. This research revealed that contemporary research is unable to identify a commonly agreeable scientific method for identification of stakeholders and their interests. This research has outlined an exhaustive list of stakeholders that have been identified by the researchers. Based upon systematic review, this research has also provided background information, recent trends and a future direction for research in the specific field of stakeholder engagement in PDR projects. © 2016, Canadian Center of Science and Education, All rights reserved.","Disaster management; Natural disasters; Post natural disaster reconstruction; Project management; Stakeholder",,"Shafique, K.; Business School, University of Queensland, St. Lucia Campus, Australia; email: k.shafique@uq.edu.au",,"Canadian Center of Science and Education",19112017,,,,"English","Asian Soc.

Whenever new evidence is published after the completion of a SLR, this SLR should be updated in order to preserve its value. However, updating SLRs involves significant effort. Objective: The goal of this paper is to investigate the application of forward snowballing to support the update of SLRs. Method: We compare outcomes of an update achieved using the forward snowballing versus a published update using the search-based approach, i.e., searching for studies in electronic databases using a search string. Results: Forward snowballing showed a higher precision and a slightly lower recall. It reduced in more than five times the number of primary studies to filter however missed one relevant study. Conclusions: Due to its high precision, we believe that the use of forward snowballing considerably reduces the effort in updating SLRs in Software Engineering; however the risk of missing relevant papers should not be underrated. © 2016 ACM.","forward snowballing; Systematic literature reviews","Software engineering; Electronic database; forward snowballing; High-precision; Research questions; Search-based; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Precision engineering",,,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,9781450344272,,,"English","Int.

Systematic reviews (SRs) aim to reduce bias and increase reliability when summarising high priority and controversial topics. Similar to SRs, systematic maps (SMs) were developed in social sciences to reliably catalogue evidence on a specific subject. Rather than providing answers to specific questions of impacts, SMs aim to produce searchable databases of studies, along with detailed descriptive information. These maps (consisting of a report, a database, and sometimes a geographical information system) can prove highly useful for research, policy and practice communities, by providing assessments of knowledge gaps (subjects requiring additional research), knowledge gluts (subjects where full SR is possible), and patterns across the research literature that promote best practice and direct research resources towards the highest quality research.

However, no meta-analysis has assessed whether including nutritional counseling as part of a telemedicine program has a significant impact on diabetes outcomes or what kind of nutritional counseling is most effective. Methods: Original research articles examining the effect of telemedicine interventions on HbA1c levels in patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes were included in this study. A literature search was performed and 92 studies were retained for analysis. We examined stratified results by differentiating interventions using no nutritional counseling from those that used nutritional counseling. We further compared between nutritional counseling administered via short message systems (SMS) such as email and text messages, and nutritional counseling administered via telephone or videoconference. Results: Telemedicine programs that include a nutritional component show similar effect in diabetes management as those programs that do not. Furthermore, subgroup analysis reveals that nutritional intervention via SMS such as email and text messages is at least as equally effective in reducing HbA1c when compared to personal nutritional counseling with a practitioner over videoconference or telephone. Conclusion: The inclusion of nutritional counseling as part of a telemedicine program does not make a significant difference to diabetes outcomes. Incorporating nutritional counseling into telemedicine programs via SMS is at least as effective as counseling via telephone or videoconference. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.","diabetes management; nutritional counseling; tele-nutrition design; Telemedicine","glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; blood; counseling; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; human; meta analysis; nutritional science; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); telemedicine; treatment outcome; Counseling; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Nutritional Sciences; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Telemedicine; Treatment Outcome","McBride, C.; Brigham Young UniversityUnited States; email: chelsea61111@gmail.com",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",1357633X,,,"26442959","English","J.

It must evolve over time in order to meet different changes in its environment, satisfy the developers' needs, and adapt to new requirements. Software developers and team members face difficulties tracking the changes others made to their software. Software visualization is one of the effective techniques that help stakeholders to better understand how software evolves, and which parts of the software are most affected by the change. Many visualization tools and techniques have been introduced by researchers and organizations to facilitate such understanding. Method: This articIe presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on software evolution visualization (SEV) tools. The SLR's main focus is to: (1) explore the main target of SEV, (2) analyze the c1assifications and taxonomies that are used to represent SEV tools, and (3) find out wh at are the main sources of information used to visualize software's evolution. Result: 29 papers were analyzed out of 55 papers. The result showed that SEV tools can be cIassified into five different groups: graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based and others. Graph-based are most popular while Notation-based are the least. SEVs focus can be either Artifact-centric visualization, Metric-centric visualization, Feature-centric visualization, or Architecture-centric visualization. The main source of information used to ex-tract information are the software repositories. ConcIusion: This work can help developer, maintainer, research er to get good knowledge about the state of software evolution and visualization as a whole. © 2016 IEEE.","CVS; Evolution; History; Repository; SEV; Software; Systematic Literature Review (SLR); Tools; Visualization","Flow visualization; Graphic methods; History; Tools; Visualization; Architecture-centric; Evolution; Repository; Software repositories; Software visualization; Sources of informations; Systematic literature review (SLR); Visualization technique; Computer software",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467389136,,,"English","Proc. - CSIT: Int.

There are different architectural approaches for implementing CDSS. Some of these approaches are based on cloud computing, which provides on-demand computing resources over internet. The goal of this paper is to determine and discuss key issues and approaches involving architectural designs in implementing a CDSS using cloud computing. To this end, we performed a standard Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of primary studies showing the intervention of cloud computing on CDSS implementations. Twenty-one primary studies were reviewed. We found that CDSS architectural components are similar in most of studies. Cloud-based CDSS are most used in Home Healthcare and Emergency Medical Systems. Alerts/Reminders and Knowledge Service are the most common implementations. Major challenges are around security, performance and compatibility. We concluded on the benefits of implementing a cloud-based CDSS, since it allows cost-efficient, ubiquitous and elastic computing resources. We highlight that some studies show weaknesses regarding the conceptualization of a cloud-based computing approach and lack of a formal methodology in the architectural design process. © 2016 IEEE.","clinical decision support systems; cloud computing; e-health; health care; software architecture; systematic review","Architectural design; Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Health care; Software architecture; Ubiquitous computing; Architectural approach; Architectural components; Clinical decision support systems; Cloud based computing; E health; Emergency Medical system; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Decision support systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509009435,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to obtain the most relevant papers from four platforms: EBSCOhost, Engineering Village, ProQuest and Web of Science. The literature was assessed and synthesized based on analysis of characteristics relating to publications, authors and the content of publications. Findings: From the SLR, 98 publications were identified and analyzed. One primary finding is that this research area appears to demonstrate characteristics of an emerging field, not yet well established across all relevant aspects. Second, a comprehensive set of 53 factors were extracted from the publications identified. These factors were analyzed according to frequency in the published literature. This set of factors can be used in future empirical research to develop a more complete understanding of the relative contribution of each to influencing CIP success. Research limitations/implications: The SLR methodology does not guarantee that all of the publications related to a given research area will be identified; however, the researchers took different actions to mitigate this limitation. Further, not all relevant information from the publication set could be included in this work because of space constraints.

However, establishment of automated testing may fail if test automation is not applied in the right time, right context and with the appropriate approach. Objective The decisions on when and what to automate is important since wrong decisions can lead to disappointments and major wrong expenditures (resources and efforts). To support decision making on when and what to automate, researchers and practitioners have proposed various guidelines, heuristics and factors since the early days of test automation technologies. As the number of such sources has increased, it is important to systematically categorize the current state-of-The-art and -practice, and to provide a synthesized overview. Method To achieve the above objective, we have performed a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) study on when and what to automate in software testing. A MLR is a form of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) which includes the grey literature (e.g., blog posts and white papers) in addition to the published (formal) literature (e.g., journal and conference papers). We searched the academic literature using the Google Scholar and the grey literature using the regular Google search engine. Results Our MLR and its results are based on 78 sources, 52 of which were grey literature and 26 were formally published sources. We used the qualitative analysis (coding) to classify the factors affecting the when- And what-to-automate questions to five groups: (1) Software Under Test (SUT)-related factors, (2) test-related factors, (3) test-tool-related factors, (4) human and organizational factors, and (5) cross-cutting and other factors. The most frequent individual factors were: need for regression testing (44 sources), economic factors (43), and maturity of SUT (39). Conclusion We show that current decision-support in software test automation provides reasonable advice for industry, and as a practical outcome of this research we have summarized it as a checklist that can be used by practitioners. However, we recommend developing systematic empirically-validated decision-support approaches as the existing advice is often unsystematic and based on weak empirical evidence. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Decision support; Multivocal literature review; Software test automation; Systematic literature review; Systematic Mapping study; What to automate; When to automate","Automation; Decision making; Decision support systems; Search engines; Software design; Testing; Decision supports; Literature reviews; Software test automation; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; What to automate; When to automate; Software testing","Garousi, V.; Software Engineering Research Group, Department of Computer Engineering, Hacettepe UniversityTurkey; email: vahid.garousi@hacettepe.edu.tr",,"Elsevier B.V.",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84969529104

Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of information and communication technologies in the adherence to antiretroviral treatment in adults with HIV/AIDS. Methodology: Systematic review conducted from March to May of 2015 in three databases-the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL); the Latin-American and Caribbean Literature in Health Sciences (LILACS/BIREME) and SCOPUS; and the Cochrane library and the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online portal (MEDLINE/PubMed). The sample consisted of nine randomized clinical trials based on the use of information and communication technologies for adherence to antiretroviral treatment in adults with HIV/AIDS. Results: Three studies analysed the use of a short message service - SMS - two phone calls, two alarm devices, one web-enabled Hand-held device and one web electronic intervention. Improvements in the levels of adherence in the group subjected to the intervention were identified in seven studies.

However, there is no comprehensive survey of these heuristics information and methods. Objective: The main objective of this study is to provide a holistic view and an in-depth analysis of what heuristics information and methods have been used, their general achievements and limitations. This study aims to provide a comprehensive summary to facilitate further research on indoor positioning heuristics. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on indoor positioning heuristics. Results: Ninety-three (93) primary studies were selected. We found two general types of heuristics information and four primary heuristics methods, which we summarised in this paper. We also found that many of these positioning heuristics are tested in experimental settings only. Some heuristics claim practical applications but are not tested for the challenging and typical indoor environments. Conclusion: Most existing heuristics information and methods rely on the assumptions that may not be true in real life environment, hence limiting the usefulness of the positioning outcomes. Based on the analysis of this SLR, we propose two research directions to enhance positioning estimation. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","heuristics algorithms; indoor environments; Positioning systems; systematic literature review","Indoor positioning systems; Heuristics algorithm; Holistic view; In-depth analysis; Indoor environment; Indoor positioning; Positioning system; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Heuristic methods","Lam, L.D.M.; Faculty of Science, Engineering and Technology, School of Software and Electrical Engineering, Swinburne University of TechnologyAustralia; email: ldlam@swin.edu.au",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17489725,,,,"English","J.

In the recent decade, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was becoming an increasingly important empirical research method in SE. One of the mechanisms of insuring the level of scientific value in the findings of an SLR is to rigorously assess its validity. Hence, it is necessary to realize the status quo and issues of TTVs of SLRs in SE. Objective: This study aims to investigate thestate-of-the-practice of TTVs of the SLRs published in SE, and further support SE researchers to improve the assessment and strategies against TTVs in order to increase the quality of SLRs in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study by reviewing the SLRs in SE that report the assessment of TTVs. Results: We identified 316 SLRs published from 2004 to the first half of 2015, in which TTVs are discussed. The issues associated to TTVs were also summarized and categorized. Conclusion: The common TTVs related to SLR research, such as internal validity and reliability, were thoroughly discussed in most SLRs. The threats to construct validity and external validity drew less attention. Moreover, there are few strategies and tactics being reported to cope with the various TTVs. © 2016 IEEE.","Evidence-Based Software Engineering; Systematic (Literature) Review; Threats to Validity","Construct validity; Empirical research method; Empirical studies; Evidence Based Software Engineering; External validities; Systematic (literature) review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Threats to Validity; Software engineering",,"Potanin A.Murphy G.C.Reeves S.Dietrich J.","IEEE Computer Society",15301362,9781509055753,,,"English","Proc.

The present systematic literature review (SLR) aims to provide a concise, comprehensive, and systematic review of the quantitative literature relating to journalists' experience of substance use. Methods: The systematic review method adopted within the present study was based on that prescribed by Fink in the 2010 book, Conducting systematic literature reviews: From the internet to paper, 3rd ed., which contains three main elements: sampling the literature, screening the literature, and extracting data. Results: Alcohol consumption is the most widely studied substance in journalist samples and is discussed in relation to quantity, level of risk, and potential alcoholism. The review also considers journalists' use of substances, including cigarettes, cannabis, and other illicit substances. In particular, comparisons are made between journalistic roles and gender. Conclusions: The research is piecemeal in nature, in that more recent research does not build upon the research that has come before it. Much of what has been reported does not reflect the progress that has taken place in recent years within the alcohol consumption and substance use field in terms of theory, assessment, scale development, practice, and interventions with those who use or are addicted to various substances.

The 16 articles reviewed were a combination of quantitative and mixed-method methodology based on the efficacy of multimedia, mobile technology, Short Messaging Services (SMS) texting, and social networking (e.g., Facebook®), to engage adolescents ages 10 to 20 years in health promotion and disease prevention. Although adolescents have high attrition rates in the studies, they demonstrated advantages in using SMS texting features and social networking, especially the chat function, in relation to health promotion and disease prevention. Some small gains were noticed in health promotion and disease prevention in the majority of the studies, though some were not significant due to attrition.

A considerable amount of research effort has been invested into improving the SCS requirements engineering process as it is critical to the successful development of SCS and, in particular, the engineering of safety aspects. Objective This article aims to investigate which approaches have been proposed to elicit, model, specify and validate safety requirements in the context of SCS, as well as to what extent such approaches have been validated in industrial settings. The paper will also investigate how the usability and usefulness of the reported approaches have been explored, and to what extent they enable requirements communication among the development project/team actors in the development of SCS. Method We conducted a systematic literature review by selecting 151 papers published between 1983 and 2014. The research methodology to conduct the SLR was based on the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Biolchini. Results The results of this systematic review should encourage further research into the design of studies to improve the requirements engineering for SCS, particularly to enable the communication of the safety requirements among the project team actors, and the adoption of other models for hazard and accident models. The presented results point to the need for more industry-oriented studies, particularly with more participation of practitioners in the validation of new approaches. Conclusion The most relevant findings from this review and their implications for further research are as follows: integration between requirements engineering and safety engineering areas; dominance of the traditional approaches; early mortality of new approaches; need for industry validation; lack of evidence for the usefulness and usability of most approaches; and the lack of studies that investigate how to improve the communication process throughout the lifecycle. Based on the findings, we suggest a research agenda to the community of researchers and advices to SCS practitioners. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The OBRP consist in generating product groups, which are collected from storage locations using material specific handling equipment. Each product group(or batch) is matched to a route, which states the sequences to pick the products in the shortest time possible. On the other hand, HVRP is a variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem(VRP), in which customers are served by a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles with various capacities, in order to delivery products in a distribution network at the lowest possible cost. Additionally, in the related literature were not identified HVRP papers that tackled order batching and routing problem (OBRP), but they were focused primarily in transportation and distribution process. Therefore, it was detected a gap in the state of the art. The comparation analysis was developed using a variation of the methodology called Systematic Literature Review (SLR) , which was based on analysis of papers. This methodology was implemented eight stages, the most important of which are as follows: i) formulating the research questions and evaluation criteria (stage 2), ii) inclusion and exclusion criteria (stage 3), iii) results of systematic review (stage 6), iv) comparative analysis between OBRP and HVRP based on set evaluation criteria (stage 7) and v) conclusions and research opportunities (stage 8). The main findings of this paper were as follow: First, order batching was not modeled in HVRP, hence relevance of this gap. Second, in order batching and routing problem is necessary to represent K heterogeneous MHE with different speed travels, load capacities and lift heights. In HVRP papers the heterogeneity is only caused by vehicles in different load capacities. Third, a constraint among n products, m storage locations and K heterogeneous EMH should be implemented to ensure the feasibility of solutions of OBRP. This constraint is raised, since any MHE are not able to pick some products from storage locations, due to theirs technical characteristics. In addition, none of HVRP papers represented this constraint. Fourth, setup time and handling time were not modeled in reviewed HVRP papers, since these times were not as significant in transportation and distribution routes. Therefore, these times should be included in HVRP to represent OBRP. Fifth, available of inventory were not considered in HVRP papers, since this condition was not important in the modeled process. It should be noted that this condition is critical in OBRP, since only can be picked products with available inventory in Distribution Centre (DC). Based on findings, it was detected a significant gap in the state of the art related to the formulation and solution a minimum time OBRP considering n products, m storage locations and K heterogeneous MHE and described constraint. Therefore, this approach, not only it will fill this gap, but also contribute to knowledge in OBRP. In addition, this paper it will be one of the first to analyze HVRP in warehouse and DC.","Distribution centre and HVRP (heterogeneous vehicle routing problem); Order batching; Picking; Routing",,,,"Universidad Politecnica de Madrid",1132175X,,,,"Spanish","Dir.

It is the contribution and benefit of ICTs to improve the government services to citizen and business organizations through the efficient intra-government operations. However, the introduction of e-Government services have become challenging nowadays because of the growing number of policies and regulations that needs to be compliant in the e-Government system development. The non-compliance of the regulatory requirements from policy and regulation may cause a significant consequence in the e-Government project development. This paper investigates and analyzes various concepts of e-Government regulatory requirements compliance from published literatures employing Systematic Literature Review (SLR).

One such sector is the agri-food sector. Using a systematic literature review (SLR) of peer-reviewed journal articles published from 1990 to 2014, the purpose of this paper is to examine the where, when, and how of the use of BMs and BMI in the agri-food sector. Design/methodology/approach – A web-based search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed journal articles that contained a combination of “BM” or “BMI” with agriculture-related and food-related terms (e.g. “agri-food sector”). After winnowing out irrelevant and duplicate articles, 505 articles were chosen for analysis. Findings – Using categories, the paper analyses various data about the selected articles. The categories include research settings, units of analysis, methodologies, and theories. Based on this analysis, the paper finds that these agri-food sector articles are primarily qualitative, empirical studies that focus on one or a few companies (i.e. case studies). The paper also finds that theory is not yet well-developed in the research on the agri-food sector. Originality/value – SLRs of various concepts, theories, and models are common in many fields (e.g. information/software technology, healthcare, and organizational management). However, no such review is available for the agri-food sector, in particular in its use of BMs and BMI. This paper addresses that gap with its review of relevant articles published in more than 300 journals in recent years. Based on this review, the paper draws conclusions about BMI in the agri-food sector and offers suggestions for future research. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Agri-food sector; Business model; Innovation; Literature review","agriculture; doctor patient relation; empiricism; human; model; software; systematic review","Tell, J.; CIEL, Halmstad UniversitySweden; email: joakim.tell@hh.se",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",0007070X,,,,"English","Br.

A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a SLR which includes grey literature in addition to the published (formal) literature. Only a few MLRs have been published in SE so far. We aim at raising the awareness for MLRs in SE by addressing two research questions (RQs): (1) What types of knowledge are missed when a SLR does not include the multivocal literature in a SE field? and (2) What do we, as a community, gain when we include the multivocal literature and conduct MLRs? To answer these RQs, we sample a few example SLRs and MLRs and identify the missing and the gained knowledge due to excluding or including the grey literature. We find that (1) grey literature can give substantial benefits in certain areas of SE, and that (2) the inclusion of grey literature brings forward certain challenges as evidence in them is often experience and opinion based. Given these conflicting viewpoints, the authors are planning to prepare systematic guidelines for performing MLRs in SE. © 2016 ACM.","Empirical software engineering; Grey literature; MLR; Multivocal Literature Reviews; Research methodology; SLR; Systematic literature reviews","Computer applications; Computer programming; Empirical Software Engineering; Grey literature; Literature reviews; Research methodologies; Systematic literature review; Software engineering",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450336918,,,"English","ACM Int.

Cost avoidance captures benefits that are not captured by cost savings e.g. spending that would have increased in the absence of the cost avoidance activity. This type of benefit can be combined with quality aspects of the product e.g. costs avoided because of defect prevention. Cost avoidance is a key driver for software reuse. Objectives: The main objectives of this study are: (1) To assess the status of capturing cost avoidance through reuse in the academia; (2) Based on the first objective, propose improvements in capturing of reuse cost avoidance, integrate these into an instrument, and evaluate the instrument in the software industry. Method: The study starts with a systematic literature review (SLR) on capturing of cost avoidance through reuse. Later, a solution is proposed and evaluated in the industry to address the shortcomings identified during the systematic literature review. Results: The results of a systematic literature review describe three previous studies on reuse cost avoidance and show that no solution, to capture reuse cost avoidance, was validated in industry. Afterwards, an instrument and a data collection form are proposed that can be used to capture the cost avoided by reusing any type of reuse artefact. The instrument and data collection form (describing guidelines) were demonstrated to a focus group, as part of static evaluation. Based on the feedback, the instrument was updated and evaluated in industry at 6 development sites, in 3 different countries, covering 24 projects in total. Conclusion: The proposed solution performed well in industrial evaluation. With this solution, practitioners were able to do calculations for reuse costs avoidance and use the results as decision support for identifying potential artefacts to reuse. © 2016 ACM.","Cost avoidance; Cost savings; Software reuse","Costs; Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Software engineering; Cost avoidances; Cost saving; Decision supports; Defect prevention; Industrial evaluations; Software organisations; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Computer software reusability",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450336918,,,"English","ACM Int.

Depending on the number of identified primary studies, the selection activity can be very time-consuming and a strategy, like SCAS, to semi-automate this activity can be helpful. Objective: To present an experimental study carried out to evaluate the SCAS strategy. Method: We conducted an experiment to compare the efficiency and effectiveness between participants using SCAS and the manual approach. They received necessary training for applying SCAS using tool support. They were divided into five groups, which conducted SRs based on their research areas. Results: When applying SCAS, the average effort reduction was 22.33%, and the average percentage error was 3.95% with a minimal loss of 1.6 evidence per SR. In addition, results showed an overall precision of 65.49% on an overall recall of 90.24% when using SCAS. The overall Kappa showed that there is a substantial agreement level between the groups and SCAS. Conclusion: The experiment increased the confidence in the strategy, reinforcing that it can reduce the effort required to select primary studies without adversely affecting the overall results of SRs. © 2016 ACM.","Evidence-based software engineering (EBSE); Experiment; Primary study selection activity; Score Citation Automatic Selection (SCAS); StArt tool; Systematic literature review (SLR)","Computer applications; Computer programming; Experiments; Automatic selection; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Percentage error; Rigorous methodologies; Study selection activities; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Tool support; Software engineering",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450336918,,,"English","ACM Int.

Job Rotation is an organizational practice whereby individuals are regularly moved among jobs or projects in the same organization. Goal: To identify and discuss evidence about job rotation, in order to understand the use, the benefits, and the limitations of this practice in software organizations. Method: A systematic literature review protocol was used to identify and select empirical studies previously published in the software engineering literature, and then coding techniques were used to analyse and synthesize their findings. Results: This review identified 18 empirical papers presenting evidence of 17 distinct studies about job rotation in software engineering. These studies revealed that in software organizations job rotation has been used to enhance communication, organizational understanding, knowledge exchange, and task variety. However, its use also requires extra effort and sometimes complex planning. Conclusion: The research about job rotation in software engineering is restricted, with only one study focusing on this topic and 16 presenting non-intentional evidence about the theme. Our review synthesized evidence that could inform research and practice. However, due to the specific nature of software development tasks and jobs, empirical evidence is still needed to guide the effective application of job rotation in practice.

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to collect the definitions for the US elementary lesions and to summarize the available data about US diagnostic accuracy in CPPD. Methods: We systematically reviewed all the studies that considered US as the index test for CPPD diagnosis without restrictions about the reference test or that provided definitions about US identification of CPPD. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for each study and definitions were extrapolated. Subgroup analyses were planned by anatomical site included in the index text and different reference standards. Results: Thirty-seven studies were included in this review. All the studies were eligible for the collection of US findings and all definitions were summarized. US description of elementary lesions appeared heterogeneous among the studies. Regarding US accuracy, 13 articles entered in the meta-analysis. Considering each joint structure, the sensitivity ranged between 0.77 (0.63-0.87) and 0.34 (0.16-0.58) while the specificity varies between 1.00 (0.89-1.00) and 0.92 (0.16-1.00). Considering the reference standards used, the sensibility ranged between 0.34 (0.02-0.65) and 0.87 (0.76-0.99) while specificity ranged between 0.84 (0.52-1.00) and 1.00 (0.99-1.00). Conclusion: US is potentially a useful tool for the diagnosis of CPPD but universally accepted definitions and further testing are necessary in order to assess the role of the technique in the diagnostic process. © 2016 Osteoarthritis Research Society International.","Chondrocalcinosis; Crystal arthropathies; Radiology; Synovial fluid analysis; Systematic review; Ultrasonography","calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate disease; diagnostic accuracy; fibrocartilage; human; hyaline cartilage; image analysis; image quality; meta analysis (topic); prevalence; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; reference value; Review; rheumatoid arthritis; sensitivity and specificity; sex ratio; synovial fluid; systematic review (topic); tendon; ultrasound; chondrocalcinosis; clinical trial; echography; multicenter study; calcium pyrophosphate; Calcium Pyrophosphate; Chondrocalcinosis; Humans; Ultrasonography","Filippou, G.; Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neurosciences, Rheumatology Section, Policlinico le Scotte, Viale Bracci 16, Italy; email: gf.filippou@gmail.com",,"W.B.

We review existing evidence for the efficacy of these medications, limitations of the literature, and resulting treatment considerations. Bibliographic searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Cochrane up to June 2015. Two reviewers independently sought studies of children with SM as primary psychiatric diagnosis, which reported response to medication treatment. Abstracts were limited to those reporting original data. Two reviewers independently assessed the ten papers reporting on >2 subjects regarding study design, key results, and limitations. Heterogeneity of designs mandated a descriptive summary. Symptomatic improvement was found for 66/79 children treated with SSRIs and 4/4 children treated with phenelzine. Only 3/10 studies had unmedicated comparison groups and only two were double-blinded. This review may be affected by publication bias, missed studies, and variability of outcome measures in included studies. Although there is some evidence for symptomatic improvement in SM with medication, especially SSRIs, it is limited by small numbers, lack of comparative trials, lack of consistent measures, and lack of consistent reporting on tolerability. The clinician must weigh this paucity of evidence against the highly debilitating nature of SM, and its adverse effects on the development of those children whose progress with psychosocial interventions is limited or very slow. Studies of optimal dosage and timing of medications in relation to psychosocial treatments are also needed. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Pharmacotherapy; Review; Selective mutism; Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors","citalopram; escitalopram; fluoxetine; fluvoxamine; moclobemide; paroxetine; phenelzine; serotonin uptake inhibitor; sertraline; monoamine oxidase inhibitor; serotonin uptake inhibitor; child; drug efficacy; human; information retrieval; pharmaceutical care; psychopharmacotherapy; Review; risk benefit analysis; selective mutism; treatment response; mutism; Child; Humans; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; Mutism; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors","Manassis, K.; Department of Psychiatry, University of TorontoCanada; email: kmmanassis@gmail.com",,"Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag GmbH and Co.

Almost 100% of the population uses text messaging worldwide and this technology is being suggested as a promising tool in psychiatry. Text messages can be sent either from a classic mobile phone or a web-based application. Reviews are needed to better understand how text messaging can be used in mental health care and other fields of medicine. Objective: The objective of the study was to review the literature regarding the use of mobile phone text messaging in mental health care. Methods: We conducted a thorough literature review of studies involving text messaging in health care management. Searches included PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases on May 25, 2015. Studies reporting the use of text messaging as a tool in managing patients with mental health disorders were included. Given the heterogeneity of studies, this review was summarized using a descriptive approach. Results: From 677 initial citations, 36 studies were included in the review. Text messaging was used in a wide range of mental health situations, notably substance abuse (31%), schizophrenia (22%), and affective disorders (17%). We identified four ways in which text messages were used: reminders (14%), information (17%), supportive messages (42%), and self-monitoring procedures (42%). Applications were sometimes combined. Conclusions: We report growing interest in text messaging since 2006. Text messages have been proposed as a health care tool in a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders including substance abuse, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and suicide prevention. Most papers described pilot studies, while some randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were also reported. Overall, a positive attitude toward text messages was reported. RCTs reported improved treatment adherence and symptom surveillance. Other positive points included an increase in appointment attendance and in satisfaction with management and health care services. Insight into message content, preventative strategies, and innovative approaches derived from the mental health field may be applicable in other medical specialties.","Cell phones; Internet; Medical informatics; Mental health; Text messaging","human; Internet; medical informatics; Mental Disorders; mental health; mobile phone; procedures; telemedicine; text messaging; utilization; Cell Phones; Humans; Internet; Medical Informatics; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Telemedicine; Text Messaging","Berrouiguet, S.; Brest Medical University Hospital at Bohars, Adult Psychiatry, Hôpital de la Cavale Blanche-Bd Tanguy PrigentFrance; email: sofian.berrouiguet@gmail.com",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,"27287668","English","J.

However, the performance heterogeneities within organisations can be explained by STP capabilities. Hence, the purpose of this paper is threefold: first, to provide a classificatory framework by categorising the various STP capabilities; second, to draw conclusions from the analysis of the empirical findings; and third, to guide further publications and identify future research needs. Design/methodology/approach – The present paper adopts a systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. In this research, the extant empirical research on STP capabilities will first be classified and integrated within a classificatory framework. Lastly, the review insights will provide methodological suggestions along with theoretical themes for future research that have not been yet explored. Findings – The study findings show that there is a strong need for a clear and unified terminology for the distinctive capabilities of STP and research has mainly highlighted certain common capabilities while other essential ones lack analysis. The SLR further reveals that most research has been quantitative in nature relying on secondary database research. Originality/value – This SLR provides a thorough overview of prior research on STP capabilities investigating 65 articles published in highly ranked peer-reviewed journals, spanning a 22-year period from 1992 to 2014. In sum, his review structures extant STP capabilities literature into a proposed classificatory framework referred to as “CLONT-framework” and highlights its critical importance in strategic management and innovation research from a theoretical, empirical, and practical point of view. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Capabilities; Capability; Performance; R&D collaboration; R&D cooperation; R&D partnership(s); Strategic alliance(s); Strategic technology partnering; Strategic technology partnership(s)",,"Kilubi, I.; Faculty of General Business Administration, University of Bremen, BremenGermany; email: i.kilubi@yahoo.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",1755425X,,,,"English","J.

Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) play a key role in the management of these tumours. Herein, we aimed at reviewing the current evidence about the role of SSAs in the treatment of gastro-entero-pancreatic (GEP)-NETs. Material and methods An extensive bibliographical search was performed in PubMed using the following keywords: gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, somatostatin analogues, octreotide, lanreotide, in order to identify all the pertinent English-written articles published between 1990 and 2015. Results SSAs have shown to help the symptomatic and biochemical improvement of patients with NETs and to exhibit a good safety profile. Recent studies have also reported a role for SSAs in tumour growth control, although the results are less impressive and the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Conclusions SSAs are well known as a symptomatic and, to lesser extent, anti-proliferative treatment in GEP-NETs. However, some issues, including optimal dosage, benefits and adverse events of combination with other molecules, and the role of new analogues, remain to be elucidated in further randomised studies. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","Gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours; lanreotide; octreotide; somatostatin analogues","angiopeptin; everolimus; interferon; metformin; octreotide; pasireotide; sunitinib; angiopeptin; antineoplastic agent; cyclopeptide; octreotide; somatostatin; tumor marker; antiproliferative activity; cancer control; carcinoid syndrome; drug effect; drug megadose; gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor; hormone release; human; induction chemotherapy; multicenter study (topic); optimal drug dose; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; tumor growth; analogs and derivatives; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; metabolism; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Pancreatic Neoplasms; practice guideline; treatment outcome; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Humans; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Octreotide; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Peptides, Cyclic; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Somatostatin; Treatment Outcome","Massironi, S.; Gastroenterology and Endoscopy Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Ca Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Via F.

These have led to an improved understanding of that relationship; however, the analysis of personality traits and their impact on the software development process is still an area under investigation and debate. Further, other than personality traits, ""team climate"" is also another factor that has also been investigated given its relationship with software teams' performance. Objective The aim of this paper is to investigate how software professionals' personality is associated with team climate and team performance. Method In this paper we detail a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the effect of software engineers' personality traits and team climate on software team performance. Results Our main findings include 35 primary studies that have addressed the relationship between personality and team performance without considering team climate. The findings showed that team climate comprises a wide range of factors that fall within the fields of management and behavioral sciences. Most of the studies used undergraduate students as subjects and as surrogates of software professionals. Conclusions The findings from this SLR would be beneficial for understanding the personality assessment of software development team members by revealing the traits of personality taxonomy, along with the measurement of the software development team working environment. These measurements would be useful in examining the success and failure possibilities of software projects in development processes. General terms Human factors, performance. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, implementing successful MPs still remains a challenge. Objectives To make a comprehensive review of the studies on MPs for bringing into light the existing measurement planning models and tools used for implementing MPs,the accumulated knowledge on the success/failure factors of MPs and mitigation strategies to address their challenges. Methods A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. In total, 65primary studies were reviewed and analyzed. Results We identified 35 measurement planning models and 11 associated tools, most of which either proposed extensions or improvements for goal based approaches. The identified success factors include (a) organizational adoption of MP, (b) integration of MP with SDLC, (c) synchronization of MP with SPI and (d) design of MP. The mostly mentioned mitigation strategies for addressing challenges are effective change management and measurement stakeholder management, automated tool support and incorporation of engineering mechanisms for designing sustainable, effective, scalable and extendible MPs, and measurement expertise and standards development. Conclusion Most of the success factors and mitigation strategies have interdependencies. Therefore, for successful MP implementation, software organizations should consider these factors in combination and make a feasibility study at the very beginning. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, its carcinogenic effects on human beings were not well discussed. The main purpose of our study is to assess carcinogenesis of SM following acute and/or chronic exposures in human beings. Methods: The valid scientific English and Persian databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, IranMedex, and Irandoc were searched and the collected papers reviewed. The used keywords were in two languages: English and Persian. The inclusion criteria were the published original articles indexed in above‑mentioned databases. Eleven full‑texts out of 296 articles were found relevant and then assessed. Results: Studies on the workers of the SM factories during the World Wars showed that the long‑term chronic exposure to mustards can cause a variety of cancers in the organs such as oral cavity, larynx, lung, and skin. Respiratory system was the most important affected system. Acute single exposure to SM was assumed as the carcinogenic inducer in the lung and blood and for few cancers including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Conclusions: SM is a proven carcinogen in chronic situations although data are not enough to strongly conclude in acute exposure. © 2016, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS).All rights reserved.","Cancer; Chemical warfare; Iraq-Iran war; Mustard gas; Sulfur mustard","mustard gas; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; aplastic anemia; basal cell carcinoma; Bowen disease; cancer incidence; carcinogenesis; chronic myeloid leukemia; DNA sequence; hematologic malignancy; Hodgkin disease; human; larynx cancer; long term exposure; lung cancer; mouth cancer; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nonlymphatic leukemia; occupational exposure; Review; sequence analysis; skin cancer; squamous cell carcinoma; systematic review (topic)","Salamati, P.; Sina Trauma and Surgery Research Center, Sina Hospital, Hassan Abad Square, Imam Khomeini Avenue, Iran; email: psalamati@tums.ac.ir",,"Isfahan University of Medical Sciences(IUMS)",20087802,,,,"English","Int.

Text messaging reminders, as electronic reminders, provide an opportunity to improve medication adherence. In this study, we aimed to provide evidence addressing the question of whether text message reminders were effective in improving patients’ adherence to medication. Evidence Acquisition: We carried out a systematic literature search, using the five electronic bibliographic databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials. Studies were included on the basis of whether they examined the benefits and effects of short-message service (SMS) interventions on medication adherence. Results: The results of this systematic review indicated that text messaging interventions have improved patients’ medication adherence rate (85%, 29.34). Included in the review, those who had problems with adherence, or those whom text messaging was most helpful had HIV, asthma, diabetes, schizophrenia and heart disease (73.5%). The period of intervention varied from 1 week to 14 months. The most common study design was randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (66%) carried out in the developed countries.

They endenger considerably increased health care costs and diminish the productivity of the adult population group and, therefore, create a burden on health, as well as on the global economy. As the management of chronic diseases involves long-term care, often lifelong patient adherence is the key for better health outcomes. We carried out a systematic literature review on the impact of mobile health interventions -mobile phone texts and/or voice messages- in high, middle and low income countries to ascertain the impact on patients' adherence to medical advice, as well as the impact on health outcomes in cases of chronic diseases. Methods: The review identified fourteen related studies following the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, in PubMed, Cochrane Library, the Library of Congress, and Web Sciences. All the interventions were critically analysed according to the study design, sample size, duration, tools used, and the statistical methods used for analysing the primary data. Impacts of the different interventions on outcomes of interest were also analysed. Results: The findings showed evidence of improved adherence, as well as health outcomes in disease management, using mobile Short Message Systems and/or Voice Calls. Significant improvement has been found on adherence with taking medicine, following diet and physical activity advice, as well as improvement in clinical parameters like HbA1c, blood glucose, blood cholesterol and control of blood pressure and asthma. Conclusions: Though studies showed positive impacts on adherence and health outcomes, three caveats should be considered, (i) there was no clear understanding of the processes through which interventions worked; (ii) none of the studies showed cost data for the m-health interventions and (iii) only short term impacts were captured, it remains unclear whether the effects are sustained. More research is needed in these three areas before drawing concrete conclusions and making suggestions to policy makers for further decision and implementation. © 2016 Yasmin et al.","Adherence; Chronic disease; Health outcomes; M-Health; Mobile phone; Short message system (SMS)","chronic disease; human; outcome assessment; patient compliance; reminder system; statistics and numerical data; telemedicine; Chronic Disease; Humans; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Compliance; Reminder Systems; Telemedicine","Yasmin, F.; Institute of Public Health, University of Heidelberg, INF 324, Germany; email: farzana@stud.uni-heidelberg.de",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14726947,,,"27106263","English","BMC Med.

However, there is a paucity of detailed SLR guidelines in operations management (OM). The recent interest in SLR in OM has not been followed by the same rigour observed in disciplines as medical sciences and public policy. There are no OM-specific SLR protocols, detailed step-by-step methods and reporting procedures. Therefore, this paper provides a step-by-step approach to SLR for OM scholars and an overview of SLRs evolution as a research method in OM and the resulting progression of themes. The step-by-step approach aims to serve as a guideline sufficiently broad to avoid skipping any significant step, but still being easy to be understood and applied. The paper describes procedures for rigourous SLR, reveals a growing use of literature review in OM, specially for qualitative SLR and traditional narrative reviews, assesses contemporary and emerging themes in OM, and provides a research agenda. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","aggregative synthesis; bibliometric analysis; meta-analysis; narrative review; Research synthesis","Computer applications; Industrial engineering; Bibliometric analysis; Meta analysis; Operations management; Research synthesis; Step-by-step approach; Step-by-step method; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Operations research","Scavarda, L.F.; Industrial Engineering Department, Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, Rua Marquês de São Vicente, 225 sala: 952, Brazil; email: lf.scavarda@puc-rio.br",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",09537287,,PPCOE,,"English","Prod Plann Control",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84956874469

However, it seems that both providers and consumers are still hesitating to enter the Cloud spot market. The relevant academic community also has conflicting opinions about Cloud spot pricing in terms of revenue generation. Aim: This work aims to systematically identify, assess, synthesize and report the published evidence in favor of or against spot-price scheme compared with fixed-price scheme of Cloud computing, so as to help relieve the aforementioned conflict. Method: We employed the systematic literature review (SLR) method to collect and investigate the empirical studies of Cloud spot pricing indexed by major electronic libraries. Results: This SLR identified 61 primary studies that either delivered discussions or conducted experiments to perform comparison between spot pricing and fixed pricing in the Cloud domain. The reported benefits and limitations were summarized to facilitate cost-benefit analysis of being a Cloud spot pricing player, while four types of theories were distinguished to help both researchers and practitioners better understand the Cloud spot market. Conclusions: This SLR shows that the academic community strongly advocates the emerging Cloud spot market. Although there is still a lack of practical and easily deployable market-driven mechanisms, the overall findings of our work indicate that spot pricing plays a promising role in the sustainability of Cloud resource exploitation. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

They engage in strategic technology partnerships (STP) for technological, commercial, industrial, and financial reasons. STP is deemed imperative for easing access to strands of technologies that are unknown to a company. This frequency analysis on STP is based on systematic literature review (SLR) approach and provides a thorough review of 57 articles published in highly-ranked peer-reviewed journals spanning a 26-year period from 1988 to the beginning of 2014. Research on STP is somewhat fragmented which, renders some of the research studies irreconcilable and impedes a greater understanding and consistency of the discipline. There is still a growing body of literature on the subject matter from various disciplinary perspectives which adopt various theoretical and methodological lenses at diverse levels of analysis. In the current paper, we analyze among other things the various methodological, research and theoretical issues underpinning STP and propose a research agenda. Hence, we contribute to the existing body of knowledge on STP literature by offering a state-of-the-art overview of current research and elaborating on promising areas for further investigation. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.","frequency analysis; joint innovation; R&D collaboration; research agenda; strategic alliance(s); strategic innovation; Strategic technology partnering; strategic technology partnership(s); systematic review",,,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

The objective of the present work was to define, using a standardized methodology and literature review, the best technical conditions for intraoperative photography. Materials and methods Using either a smartphone camera, a bridge camera, or a single-lens reflex (SLR) camera, photographs were taken under various standard conditions by a professional photographer. All images were independently assessed blinded to technical conditions to define the best shooting conditions and methods. Results For better photographs, an SLR camera with manual settings should be used. Photographs should be centered and taken vertically and orthogonal to the surgical field with a linear scale to avoid error in perspective. The shooting distance should be about 75 cm using an 80-100-mm focal lens. Flash should be avoided and scialytic low-powered light should be used without focus. The operative field should be clean, wet surfaces should be avoided, and metal instruments should be hidden to avoid reflections. For SLR camera, International Organization for Standardization speed should be as low as possible, autofocus area selection mode should be on single point AF, shutter speed should be above 1/100 second, and aperture should be as narrow as possible, above f/8. For smartphone, use high dynamic range setting if available, use of flash, digital filter, effect apps, and digital zoom is not recommended. Conclusions If a few basic technical rules are known and applied, high-quality photographs can be taken by amateur photographers and fit the standards accepted in clinical practice, academic communication, and publications. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The quantification of the combined and relative impacts of influential factors on SWI has not previously been considered in coastal aquifers. In the present study, a systematic review of the available literature on this topic is first provided. Then, the potential remaining challenges are scrutinized. Open questions on the effects of more realistic complexities such as gradual SLR, parameter uncertainties, and the associated influences in decision-making models are issues requiring further investigation.We assess and quantify the seawater toe location under the impacts of SLR in combination with recharge rate variations, land-surface inundation (LSI) due to SLR, aquifer bed slope variation, and changing landward boundary conditions (LWBCs). This is the first study to include all of these factors in a single analysis framework. Both analytical and numerical models are used for these sensitivity assessments. It is demonstrated that (1) LSI caused by SLR has a significant incremental impact on the seawater toe location, especially in the flatter coasts and the flux-controlled (FC) LWBCs, however this impact is less than the reported orders of magnitude differences which were estimated using only analytical solutions; (2) LWBCs significantly influence the SLR impacts under almost all conditions considered in this study; (3) The main controlling factors of seawater toe location are the magnitudes of fresh groundwater discharge to sea and recharge rate. Regional freshwater flux entering from the landward boundary and the groundwater hydraulic gradient are the major contributors of fresh groundwater discharge to sea for both FC and head-controlled (HC) systems, respectively; (4) A larger response of the aquifer and larger seawater toe location changes are demonstrable for a larger ratio of the aquifer thickness to the aquifer length particularly in the HC systems; (5) The lowest sensitivity of seawater toe location is found for the density difference ratio of the seawater and freshwater, and also for the aquifer bed slope; (6) The early-time observations show seawater fingers below the inundated lands due to SLR which are diminished and ultimately extinguished; and (7) A less than 2% reversal effect on the seawater toe location after overshoot mechanism is observed in the transient simulations which suggests that this mechanism is an insignificant and impractical factor compared to other more significant factors. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Coastal aquifers; Groundwater; Sea-level rise; Seawater intrusion","Aquifers; Climate change; Decision making; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Location; Mercury (metal); Salt water intrusion; Sea level; Seawater; Seawater effects; Uncertainty analysis; Water; Analytical and numerical models; Coastal aquifers; Decision making models; Ground water discharge; Groundwater hydraulics; Main controlling factors; Parameter uncertainty; Sea level rise; Recharging (underground waters); aquifer; assessment method; boundary condition; coastal aquifer; complexity; decision making; discharge; estuarine front; numerical model; recharge; saline intrusion; sea level change; seawater","Ketabchi, H.; Department of Water Resources Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, PO Box 14115-336, Iran; email: h.ketabchi@modares.ac.ir",,"Elsevier",00221694,,JHYDA,,"English","J.

Firstly, KM practices found were categorized according to Ho (2009). Secondly, the financial indicators used were compared to indicators identified by Combs; Crook; Shook (2005). Thirdly, the most frequently measures used in the relationship between KM practices and financial performance were identified. Finally, we highlighted the most used methods to evaluate impact of KM in FP, evaluation of number of Publications per year and evaluation of Authors, Publishers. The paper finds that in despite of increasing number of publications correlating both topics the effects of KM in financial performance has to be more explored.

In addition, it aims to review and summarize the clinical outcomes associated with the palliative treatment of bone metastases using different radiopharmaceuticals. Materials and methods: A literature search was conducted on Science Direct and PubMed databases (1990 - 2015). The following search terms were combined in order to obtain relevant results: ""bone"", ""metastases"", ""palliative"", ""care"", ""therapy"", ""treatment"", ""radiotherapy"", ""review"", ""radiopharmaceutical"", ""phosphorus-32"", ""strontium-89"", ""yttrium-90"", ""tin-117m"", ""samarium-153"", ""holmium-166"", ""thulium-170"", ""lutetium-177"", ""rhenium-186"", ""rhenium-188"" and ""radium-223"".

Objective: The main objective of the described work was to perform an SMS on DSLs to better understand the DSL research field, identify research trends, and any possible open issues. The set of research questions was inspired by a DSL survey paper published in 2005. Method: We conducted a SMS over 5 stages: defining research questions, conducting the search, screening, classifying, and data extraction. Our SMS included 1153 candidate primary studies from the ISI Web of Science and ACM Digital Library, 390 primary studies were classified after screening. Results: This SMS discusses two main research questions: research space and trends/demographics of the literature within the field of DSLs. Both research questions are further subdivided into several research sub-questions. The results from the first research question clearly show that the DSL community focuses more on the development of new techniques/methods rather than investigating the integrations of DSLs with other software engineering processes or measuring the effectiveness of DSL approaches. Furthermore, there is a clear lack of evaluation research. Amongst different DSL development phases more attention is needed in regard to domain analysis, validation, and maintenance. The second research question revealed that the number of publications remains stable, and has not increased over the years. Top cited papers and venues are mentioned, as well as identifying the more active institutions carrying DSL research.

Thus, making well-informed design decisions is a critical factor in developing DSMLs. To support this decision-making process, the model-driven development community has started to collect established design practices in terms of patterns, guidelines, story-telling, and procedural models. However, most of these documentation practices do not capture the details necessary to reuse the rationale behind these decisions in other DSML projects. In this paper, we report on a three-year research effort to compile and to empirically validate a catalog of structured decision descriptions (decision records) for UML-based DSMLs. This catalog is based on design decisions extracted from 90 DSML projects. These projects were identified - among others - via an extensive systematic literature review (SLR) for the years 2005-2012. Based on more than 8,000 candidate publications, we finally selected 84 publications for extracting design-decision data. The extracted data were evaluated quantitatively using a frequent-item-set analysis to obtain characteristic combinations of design decisions and qualitatively to document recurring documentation issues for UML-based DSMLs. We revised the collected decision records based on this evidence and made the decision-record catalog for developing UML-based DSMLs publicly available. Furthermore, our study offers insights into UML usage (e.g. diagram types) and into the adoption of UML extension techniques (e.g. metamodel extensions, profiles). © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In the software development process, they are primarily used for documentation and communication purposes in analysis, design, and implementation activities. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) further increases the importance of models, as in MDE models are not only used for documentation and communication, but as central artefacts of the software development process. Various recent research approaches take the idea of using models as central artefacts one step further by using models at runtime to cope with dynamic aspects of ever-changing software and its environment. In this article, we analyze the usage of models at runtime in the existing research literature using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) research method. The main goals of our SLR are building a common classification and surveying the existing approaches in terms of objectives, techniques, architectures, and kinds of models used in these approaches.

The most eminent shortcoming of the CF technique is the sparsity problem. This problem refers to the low ratio of rated items by users to the total number of available items; hence the quality of recommendation will be affected. Most researchers use implicit data as a solution for sparsity problem, to decrease the dependency of CF technique on the user’s rating and this term is more common in this field. The aim of this research is to aggregate evidence on state of research and practice of CF and implicit data applying systematic literature review (SLR) which is a method for evidence-based software engineering (EBSE). EBSE has the potential value for synthesizing evidence and make this evidence available to practitioners and researchers with providing the best references and appropriate software engineering solutions for sparsity problem. We executed the standard systematic literature review method using a manual search in 5 prestigious databases and 38 studies were finally included for analyzing. This paper follows manifestation of Kitchenham’s SLR guidelines and describes in a great detail the process of selecting and analyzing research papers. This paper is first academic systematic literature review of CF technique along with implicit data from user behaviors and activities to aggregate existing evidence as a synthesis of best quality scientific studies. The 38 research papers are categorized into eleven application fields (movie, shopping, books, Social systems, music and others) and six data mining techniques (dimensionality reduction, association rule, heuristic methods and other). According to the review results, neighborhood formation is a relevant aspect of CF and it can be improved with the use of user-item preference matrix as implicit feedback mechanism, the most common domains of CF are in e-commerce and movie software applications. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Collaborative filtering; Evidence-based software engineering; Implicit feedback; Sparsity problem; Systematic literature review; User activities","Aggregates; Application programs; Behavioral research; Data mining; Feedback; Heuristic methods; Software engineering; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Implicit feedback; Sparsity problems; Systematic literature review; User activity; Collaborative filtering","Najafabadi, M.K.; Advanced Informatics School (AIS), Universiti Technologi Malaysia (UTM)Malaysia; email: maryam64266@yahoo.com",,"Springer Netherlands",02692821,,AIRVE,,"English","Artif Intell Rev",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954375447

These issues are specifically addressed by so-called systematic literature reviews (SLR) that propose a strict protocol for the search and appraisal of literature. Moreover, SLR are claimed to be a ‘standardized method’ for literature reviews, that is, replicable, transparent, objective, unbiased, and rigorous, and thus superior to other approaches for conducting literature reviews. These are significant and consequential claims that - 2014; despite increasing adoption of SLR - 2014; remained largely unnoticed in the information systems (IS) literature. The objective of this debate is to draw attention of the IS community to SLR’s claims, to question their justification and reveal potential risks of their adoption. This is achieved by first examining the origins of SLR and the prescribed systematic literature review process and then by critically assessing their claims and implications. In this debate, we show that SLR are applicable and useful for a very specific kind of literature review, a meta study that identifies and summarizes evidence from earlier research. We also demonstrate that the claims that SLR provide superior quality are not justified. More importantly, we argue that SLR as a general approach to conducting literature reviews is highly questionable, concealing significant perils. The paper cautions that SLR could undermine critical engagement with literature and what it means to be scholarly in academic work. © The Editor(s) 2015.","Conducting literature reviews; Database searches; Literature review; Narrative literature review; SLR; Systematic literature reviews",,,,"Palgrave Macmillan",,9781137509888; 9781137509864,,,"English","Formulating Research Methods for Inf.

Sustainable freight transports today are on the political, social and technological agenda of many actors operating in urban contexts. Due to the extent of the covered areas and the continuous progress in many fields, the resulting body of research on urban logistics appears quite fragmented. From an engineering management perspective, the purpose of this paper is to present a systematic literature review (SLR) that aims to consolidate the knowledge on urban logistics, analyse the development of the discipline, and provide future research directions. Design/methodology/approach: The paper discusses the main evidence emerging from a SLR on urban logistics. The corpus resulting from the SLR has been used to perform a citation network analysis and a main path analysis that together underpin the identification of the most investigated topics and methodologies in the field. Findings: Through the analysis of a corpus of 104 articles, the most important research contributions on urban logistics that represent the structural backbone in the development of the research over time in the field are detected. Based on these findings, this work identifies and discusses three areas of potential interest for future research.

The study was conducted following the SLR approach, taking into account only scientific documents published between 2004 and 2013. The revision consisted of four phases: search process, inclusion and exclusion filter, quality assessment, and data extraction, each of which was intended to select the most suitable information to help answer the research questions; case studies were mainly considered for future applications in organizations. The results of each document were identified as well as its activities, roles, tools, variables and indicators. The findings did not explicitly show documents where the implementation of Knowledge Codification Process was specified. As a result, based on the revision of the literature, the different components were taken from alternative processes. The results show first general aspects, presenting the number of documents per industry, per outcome and per research method used, followed by the list of activities, roles, tools, variables and indicators organized by the number of documents and by the type of outcome found in the revision. The result of the SLR can be a starting point to create an implementation model of Knowledge Codification Process, as well as give the readers an overview of the state of Knowledge Codification Process and promote Knowledge Management community in future investigations.

The results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) show that there are different ways to carry out Agile RE approaches, what increases heterogeneity among them. This thesis studies how a commonly accepted framework for Agile RE looks like. To this end, the initial phase for creating a methodology based on a pattern approach will be performed. Therefore, the design science research methodology is applied to carry out the research. The designed artifact is a metamodel that describes the Agile RE process at an abstract level.

The industry and geographical focus is on the manufacturing sector and Southwest Germany, respectively. Against this background, especially the sophisticated technical consumer goods and investment goods contribute greatly to the competitive advantage of the region as a whole. The contribution combines considerations of different theories and examines the field from multiple angles: (1) regions and factories as systems, (2) proximity, (3) competitive advantage. A systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is applied in order to substantiate each of the three pillars. The work results in a set of characteristics describing requirements for an analytical framework or management model in order to successfully shape a regions future by the systematic identification and leverage of efficiency potentials. The scope of action is the extended regional infrastructure, which comprises elements of various systems, such as economy, politics, administration, and science. It is argued that the different systems, as well as their subsystems (e.g. organizations within the economic or scientific sector), have to be recognized as generally independent and self-organized. Therefore, a key task is related to the coordination of systems which can be understood as the formation and configuration of a structural coupling. © 2016 The Authors.","Complex Social Systems; Efficiency Potentials; Extended Regional Infrastructure; Literature Review","Competition; Complex networks; Economics; Efficiency; Investments; Competitive advantage; Complex social systems; Literature reviews; Manufacturing sector; Regional infrastructure; Structural coupling; Systematic identification; Systematic literature review (SLR); Manufacture","Kuch, B.; Graduate School of Excellence Advanced Manufacturing Engineering (GSaME), University of Stuttgart, Allmandring 35, Germany; email: benjamin.kuch@gsame.uni-stuttgart.de","Bauernhansl T.Westkamper E.","Elsevier B.V.",22128271,,,,"English","Procedia CIRP",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006974344

One reason for the popularity of big data research is the knowledge that can be extracted from analyzing these large data sets. However, data can contain sensitive information, and data must therefore be sufficiently protected as it is stored and processed. Furthermore, it might also be required to provide meaningful, proven, privacy guarantees if the data can be linked to individuals. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no systematic overview of the overlap between big data and the area of security and privacy. Consequently, this review aims to explore security and privacy research within big data, by outlining and providing structure to what research currently exists. Moreover, we investigate which papers connect security and privacy with big data, and which categories these papers cover. Ultimately, is security and privacy research for big data different from the rest of the research within the security and privacy domain? To answer these questions, we perform a systematic literature review (SLR), where we collect recent papers from top conferences, and categorize them in order to provide an overview of the security and privacy topics present within the context of big data. Within each category we also present a qualitative analysis of papers representative for that specific area. Furthermore, we explore and visualize the relationship between the categories.

However, attacks targeting devices and services of a ubicomp environment have demonstrated not only different privacy issues, but also a risk of endangering user’s life (e.g. by modifying medical sensor readings). Thus, the aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of security challenges of ubicomp environments and the corresponding countermeasures proposed over the past decade. Design/methodology/approach: The results of this paper are based on a literature review method originally used in evidence-based medicine called systematic literature review (SLR), which identifies, filters, classifies and summarizes the findings. Findings: Starting from the bibliometric results that clearly show an increasing interest in the topic of ubicomp security worldwide, the findings reveal specific types of attacks and vulnerabilities that have motivated the research over the past decade. This review describes most commonly proposed countermeasures – context-aware access control and authentication mechanisms, cryptographic protocols that account for device’s resource constraints, privacy-preserving mechanisms, and trust mechanisms for wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLR on security challenges in ubicomp. The findings should serve as a reference to an extensive list of scientific contributions, as well as a guiding point for the researchers’ novel to the security research in ubicomp. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Security; Ubiquitous computing",,"Kusen, E.; Institute for Information Systems and New Media, Vienna University of Economics and Business (WU Vienna)Austria; email: ekusen@wu.ac.at",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17427371,,,,"English","Int.

We hypothesize that inspections focused on identifying errors (i.e., root cause of faults) are better at finding requirements faults when compared to inspection methods that rely on checklists created using lessons-learned from historical fault-data. Our previous work verified that, error based inspections guided by an initial requirements errors taxonomy (RET) performed significantly better than standard fault-based inspections. However, RET lacked an underlying human information processing model grounded in Cognitive Psychology research. The current research reports results from a systematic literature review (SLR) of Software Engineering and Cognitive Science literature - Human Error Taxonomy (HET) that contains requirements phase human errors. The major contribution of this paper is a report of control group study that compared the fault detection effectiveness and usefulness of HET with the previously validated RET. Results of this study show that subjects using HET were not only more effective at detecting faults, but they found faults faster. Post-hoc analysis of HET also revealed meaningful insights into the most commonly occurring human errors at different points during requirements development. The results provide motivation and feedback for further refining HET and creating formal inspection tools based on HET.","Empirical study; Human error; Requirements inspection; Taxonomy","Bionics; Computer software selection and evaluation; Fault detection; Inspection; Knowledge engineering; Software engineering; Systematic errors; Taxonomies; Cognitive psychology; Empirical investigation; Empirical studies; Fault detection effectiveness; High-quality software; Human errors; Human information-processing model; Systematic literature review (SLR); Errors",,,"Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School",23259000,189170639X; 9781891706394,,,"English","Proc.

They may have much personal, social, cultural, psychological, and cognitive diversity. Forming suitable learning groups represents, therefore, a hard and time-consuming task. In Mobile Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (MCSCL) environments, this task is more difficult. Instructors need to consider many more issues, such as the rapid change of mobile learners' context, their direct and naturel interaction, and the characteristics of mobile devices and networks. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) that examines the relevant solutions for the problem of group formation in MCSCL environments. In the context of this SLR, an initial list of 178 papers was reviewed. After careful analysis of each paper using specific selection criteria and a quality assessment method, a final list of 12 relevant studies was filtered and used to answer the research questions. The findings revealed that: (a) there is a lack of approaches addressing the group formation problem in MCSCL environments; (b) the most proposed solutions do not allow instructors to customize the grouping process; (c) there is no useful solutions to automatically capture and evaluate many of learners' behaviours and context information; (d) the majority of approaches do not support a dynamic formation of learning groups; (e) the majority of approaches do not provide descriptions about the implemented grouping algorithms nor about the evaluation methods.

A SOP is different to ordinary software development outsourcing relationship. Usually a successful outsourcing relationship may lead to SOP. Software companies currently use a wide variety of mechanisms to outsource software development work. Beside all, SOP is an emerging strategy. The development of SOP depends on the proper implementation of various critical success factors (CSFs) like ‘mutual trust’, ‘effective and timely communication’, ‘mutual interdependence and shared values’, ‘organisational proximity’, ‘quality production’ and ‘3C (coordination, cooperation and collaboration)’. Moreover, the practices of SOP in the software industry are very little. The objective of this research is to identify practices for implementing CSFs in SOP.

Methods Four electronic databases were searched from their inception to March 2015 to identify all relevant trials. Reference lists of retrieved articles were hand-searched. All data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers, and risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Back Review Group Risk of Bias tool. Results Nine randomized controlled trials were included in the systematic review, and 4 were found to be eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Participants in the SM group had improved symptoms compared with participants receiving sham treatment (standardized mean difference = − 0.36; 95% confidence interval, − 0.59 to − 0.12). The majority of studies were of low risk of bias; however, several of the studies were small, the practitioner could not be blinded, and some studies did not conduct intention-to-treat analysis and had a high level of dropouts. Conclusion There is some evidence that SM has specific treatment effects and is more effective at reducing nonspecific low back pain when compared with an effective sham intervention. However, given the small number of studies included in this analysis, we should be cautious of making strong inferences based on these results. © 2016","Low back pain; Manipulation; Placebo; Review of the literature; Spinal",,"Perry, R.E.; Bristol Nutrition BRU, Education & Research Centre, Level 3, Upper Maudlin St, United Kingdom; email: Rachel.Perry@bristol.ac.uk",,"Elsevier USA",15563707,,,,"English","J.

Objective: To identify and analyze the existing works on the modeling of Software Reliability based on International Standards as the starting point for a reliability assessment proposal based on ISO/IEC-25000 ""Software Product Quality Requirements and Evaluation"" (SQuaRE) series. Method: The work methodology is based on the guidelines provided in Evidence Based Software Engineering for Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR). Results: A total of 1820 works were obtained as a result of the SLR search, more than 800 primary studies were selected after data filtering. After scrutiny, over thirty of those were thoroughly analyze, the results obtained show a very limited application of SB-SRM particularly to industrial environment. Conclusion: Our analysis point to the complexity of the proposed models together with the difficulties involved in applying them to the management of engineering activities as a root cause to be considered for such limited application. The various stakeholder needs are also a point of paramount importance that should be better covered if the industrial applicability of the proposed models is to be increased. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The study aims to highlight and associate the core elements for adopting the offsite concept in different construction contexts. This ultimately facilitates the enhancement of the offsite uptake. Design/methodology/approach-The research study was carried out through a systematic literature review (SLR). The SLR was conducted to identify and understand the existing themes in the offsite research landscape, evaluate contributions and compile knowledge, thereby identifying potential directions of future research. The grand electronic databases were explored to gather literature on the offsite concept, lean and agile principles and simulation. A total of 62 related articles published between 1992 and 2015 have been included in this study. The relevant literature was systematically analysed and synthesised to present the emerging offsite themes. Findings-The descriptive and thematic analyses presented in this paper have identifed related offsite research studies that have contributed to setting a frm foundation of the offsite concept in different construction contexts. Each of the 62 articles was examined for achieving the aim and objectives of this study, the method of data collection and coverage of offsite themes. The results of the analyses revealed that the articles mostly provide information on the offsite concept and its defnitions (53 per cent) and offsite barriers and/or drivers (27 per cent). However, limited attention has been paid to the integration of lean and agile principles (13 per cent) and simulation (7 per cent) within the offsite concept, which are therefore more open to research within the offsite concept. Research limitations/implications-The literature review highlights the main themes and components of the offsite construction concept. This forms a solid basis and motivation for researchers and practitioners to build on to enhance the uptake of the offsite concept in different contexts. This study also presents a research roadmap within the offsite concept, along with a recommendation for further research to be conducted using the research framework proposed in this study. The framework could lead to validation of using simulation to integrate lean and agile principles within the offsite concept. Originality/value-This paper presents a systematic review of the literature related to offsite construction in different contexts. The emerging components, that is, offsite defnitions, drivers and/or barriers, lean and agile principles and simulation have been highlighted and discussed thematically. A research framework that enables pursuit of the integration of lean and agile principles offsite through the lens of simulation has been proposed. The framework is expected to open up new opportunities on the effectiveness of offsite development in different contexts. © 2016 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Future roadmap and framework; Lean and agile principles; Modelling and simulation; Offsite construction; Offsite manufacturing; Systematic literature review",,"Mostafa, S.; School of Natural and Built Environments, University of South AustraliaAustralia; email: Sherif.mostafa@mymail.unisa.edu.au",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14714175,,,,"English","Constr.

Methods: Two SLRs focused on clinical trials employing a treatment approach targeting a specific clinical outcome were performed. In addition to testing clinical, functional and/or structural changes as endpoints, comorbidities, cardiovascular risk, work productivity and education as well as patient self-assessment were investigated. The searches covered MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane databases and Clinicaltrial.gov for the period between 2009 and 2012 and separately for the period of 2012 to May of 2014. Results: Of 8442 citations retrieved in the two SLRs, 176 articles underwent full-text review. According to predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria, six articles were included of which five showed superiority of a targeted treatment approach aiming at least at low-disease activity versus routine care; in addition, publications providing supportive evidence were also incorporated that aside from expanding the evidence provided by the above six publications allowed concluding that a targetoriented approach leads to less comorbidities and cardiovascular risk and better work productivity than conventional care. Conclusions: The current study expands the evidence that targeting low-disease activity or remission in the management of RA conveys better outcomes than routine care.",,"disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; methotrexate; antirheumatic agent; Article; cardiovascular risk; comorbidity; DAS28; disease assessment; human; meta analysis; priority journal; productivity; randomized controlled trial (topic); remission; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; self evaluation; systematic review; treat to target; treatment outcome; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; clinical trial (topic); diagnostic imaging; evidence based medicine; pathophysiology; patient care planning; radiography; severity of illness index; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Clinical Trials as Topic; Comorbidity; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Patient Care Planning; Radiography; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome","Stamm, T.A.; Department of Medicine 3, Division of Rheumatology, Medical University of Vienna, Währinger Gürtel 18-20 A, Austria; email: tanja.stamm@meduniwien.ac.at",,"BMJ Publishing Group",00034967,,ARDIA,"25990290","English","Ann.

Students in universities and colleges are dependent on wordy textbook and lecture notes to study. Use of visual contents depends on educator's interests, needs and willingness to provide the material to students. Nowadays, learning started to emerge at a rapid pace in producing learners with excellent academic achievements. The role of cloud computing hence increases the capability of delivering education from educator's perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to highlight important features of cloud computing in enhancing the use of interactive visual content in higher education learning and promotes interactive learning to students. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method is used to obtain primary data from online databases Scopus and by using the coding procedure in Grounded Theory(Strauss & Corbin, 1990), research produces meta-model data of codes extractions from primary data.

Regardless of whether the development disciplines are traditional or agile, effort estimation attempts to systematically attach to other development elements. It is important to estimate the work load at the very beginning, despite the initial drawback of there being very little known about the project. And if, in addition, the effort estimations are accurate, they can contribute a lot to the success of a project being developed. There are many approaches and methods available for performing effort estimation, each one with their own features, as well as pros and cons. Some of them are more appropriate for traditional software development projects, while others are meant for agile software development projects. The latter is also the subject of the systematic literature review presented in the article. Based on the set research questions, we researched the area of effort estimation in an agile software development project. Which methods are available, how objective the estimation is, what influence the estimation and most importantly how accurate those methods and approaches are. The research questions were answered and the basis for future empirical work was set.","Agile; Effort estimation; Estimation accuracy; SLR; Software development","Application programs; Computer software selection and evaluation; Quality control; Software engineering; Agile; Agile software development projects; Effort Estimation; Research questions; Software development projects; Systematic literature review; Work loads; Software design",,"Horvath Z.Kozsik T.Budimac Z.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988985797

GSD aims at delivering remarkable software through a widely distributed pool of experts, with reduced efforts, minimum cost and time. In recent years, GSD developers have reshaped the development processes and have adopted agile techniques and green engineering principles to cope with the frequent changes in requirements, accelerate the development in short increments and to produce energy efficient and sustainable software. However, the adoption of agile methods for developing sustainable software possesses a number of challenges. This paper presents a list of potential challenges/risks identified through systematic literature review (SLR) that need to be avoided by the GSD vendors using agile methods for the development of green and sustainable software. Our findings reveal eight risk factors that are faced by GSD vendors in the development of green and sustainable software using agile methods. GSD vendors are encouraged to address properly all the identified factors in general and the most-frequently cited critical risks in particular, such as in-sufficient system documentation, limited support for real-time systems and large systems, management overhead, lack of customer's presence, lack of formal communication and lack of long term planning.

The treat-to-target recommendations, formulated in 2010, have provided a basis for implementation of a strategic approach towards this therapeutic goal in routine clinical practice, but these recommendations need to be re-evaluated for appropriateness and practicability in the light of new insights. Objective: To update the 2010 treat-to-target recommendations based on systematic literature reviews (SLR) and expert opinion. Methods: A task force of rheumatologists, patients and a nurse specialist assessed the SLR results and evaluated the individual items of the 2010 recommendations accordingly, reformulating many of the items. These were subsequently discussed, amended and voted upon by >40 experts, including 5 patients, from various regions of the world. Levels of evidence, strengths of recommendations and levels of agreement were derived. Results: The update resulted in 4 overarching principles and 10 recommendations. The previous recommendations were partly adapted and their order changed as deemed appropriate in terms of importance in the view of the experts. The SLR had now provided also data for the effectiveness of targeting low-disease activity or remission in established rather than only early disease. The role of comorbidities, including their potential to preclude treatment intensification, was highlighted more strongly than before. The treatment aim was again defined as remission with low-disease activity being an alternative goal especially in patients with long-standing disease. Regular follow-up (every 1-3 months during active disease) with according therapeutic adaptations to reach the desired state was recommended. Follow-up examinations ought to employ composite measures of disease activity that include joint counts. Additional items provide further details for particular aspects of the disease, especially comorbidity and shared decision-making with the patient. Levels of evidence had increased for many items compared with the 2010 recommendations, and levels of agreement were very high for most of the individual recommendations (≥9/10). Conclusions: The 4 overarching principles and 10 recommendations are based on stronger evidence than before and are supposed to inform patients, rheumatologists and other stakeholders about strategies to reach optimal outcomes of RA.",,"glucocorticoid; antirheumatic agent; Article; clinical practice; comorbidity; disease activity; disease duration; follow up; functional assessment; health care planning; human; medical decision making; medical literature; priority journal; remission; rheumatoid arthritis; systematic review; treatment contraindication; treatment response; treatment withdrawal; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; consensus development; evidence based medicine; maintenance chemotherapy; nomenclature; pathology; pathophysiology; patient care planning; patient participation; severity of illness index; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Comorbidity; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Maintenance Chemotherapy; Patient Care Planning; Patient Participation; Remission Induction; Severity of Illness Index; Terminology as Topic","Smolen, J.S.; Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine 3, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, Austria; email: josef.smolen@meduniwien.ac.at",,"BMJ Publishing Group",00034967,,ARDIA,"25969430","English","Ann.

Although vaccination may prevent numerous infections, vaccination uptake rates are low in this group of patients. Objectives: To develop evidence-based recommendations for vaccination in SIRD patients. Methods: We searched MEDLINE (until 31 October 2014) and EMBASE (until 14 December 2014) databa - ses, as well as the ACR and EULAR congress abstracts (2011-2014). Patients with any systemic inflammatory rheumatic disease were included and all vaccines were considered. Any safety and efficacy outcomes were admitted. Search results were submitted to title and abstract selection, followed by detailed review of suitable studies. Data were subsequently pooled accor - ding to the type of vaccine and the SIRD considered. Results were presented and discussed by a multidisci-plinary panel and systematic literature review (SLR)- -derived recommendations were voted according to the Delphi method. The level of agreement among rheumatologists was assessed using an online survey. Results: Eight general and seven vaccine-specific re - commendations were formulated. Briefly, immunization status should routinely be assessed in all SIRD patients. The National Vaccination Program should be followed and some additional vaccines are recommended. To maximize the efficacy of vaccination, vaccines should preferably be administered 4 weeks before starting immunosuppression or, if possible when disease activity is controlled. Non-live vaccines are safe in SIRD, including immunosuppressed patients. The safety of live attenuated vaccines in immunosuppressed patients deserves further ascertainment, but might be considered in particular situations. Discussion: The present recommendations combine scientific evidence with the multidisciplinary expertise of our taskforce panel and attained desirable agreement among Portuguese rheumatologists. Vaccination re - commendations need to be updated on a regular basis, as more scientific data regarding vaccination efficacy and safety, emergent infectious threats, new vaccines as well as new immunomodulatory therapies become available.","Antirheumatic agents; Biological products; Immunosuppressive agents; Recommendations; Rheumatic diseases; Vaccination","adult; Bacterial Infections; complication; human; inflammation; practice guideline; rheumatic disease; vaccination; Virus Diseases; Adult; Bacterial Infections; Humans; Inflammation; Rheumatic Diseases; Vaccination; Virus Diseases",,,"Sociedade Portuguesa de Reumatologia",0303464X,,ARUPB,"27606471","English","Acta Reumatol.

The consumption of fruits and vegetables (FV) is a protective factor for obesity, but their consumption is often below the recommendations. Objective: To identify the level of fruit consumption in human development cycles, as well as the data on the association of fruit consumption with excess weight in Brazil. Methods: A non-systematic literature review on the Virtual Health Library (VHL) databases for the period 2005 to 2015. A total of 23 studies were selected in the English and Portuguese languages, according to the study design and population group. Only cohorts and cross sections studies in Brazil were selected. Appropriate FV consumption was considered to be 400 g/day or a frequency of 5 servings/day (3 servings/day of fruits), and overweight was evaluated according to each age group and development cycle. Results: The average consumption for pregnant women was found to be 350 g/day; an inverse relationship was found between total fibre consumption and gestational weight gain. The average consumption of FV for children and adolescents has remained between 30% and 40%, consumption falling with increasing age. Vigitel data between 2006 and 2014 shows an increase in the prevalence of adequate consumption of FV for adults and seniors according to gender, age and education. Appropriate consumption tripled during this period. There was an association between fruit consumption and weight loss, increased risk of obesity, abdominal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia and presence of metabolic syndrome (SM). Conclusions: The prevalence of adequate consumption of FV is low in all regions of Brazil and among all age groups, the highest prevalence is among women and increases with the advance of age, higher education level and higher socioeconomic status. Adequate fruit consumption correlates to weight loss and/or weight gain control of individuals.","Adults; Brazil; Children; Fruit consumption; Obesity/overweight; Pregnancy; Seniors; Teens",,"Feferbaum, R.; Livre Docente em Pediatria - Instituto da Criança, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, Departamento de Pediatria da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São PauloBrazil; email: rfeferbaum@uol.com.br",,"Centro de Estudos de Crescimento e Desenvolvimento do Ser Humano",01041282,,,,"English","J.

The present paper aims to provide a detailed map of common and best practices in terms of curriculum content and methods of teaching entrepreneurship on the tertiary level, and to explore how they correlate with practices recommended by the entrepreneurial learning field of research, in order to contribute to extracting best practice. This paper uses a systematic literature review (SLR) to help review the literature in a transparent and unbiased way. The review is undertaken through six stages using NVivo computer software. In each stage, the literature on EE is screened and filtered to reduce the size and try to reach the more relevant and useful papers. This process end up with 129 articles divided between EE and entrepreneurship learning. The result of the reviewing process reveals that the curricula content and teaching methods vary depending on the programme’s objectives—from theoretical courses aiming to increase entrepreneurial awareness to practical-oriented ones that aim to produce graduates ready to start a business. Practical-oriented courses correlate with entrepreneurial learning suggestions for practices to engage students in acquiring entrepreneurial competencies. However, to better extract best practice, it would be useful if future research could explore what, exactly, it is that we mean when we use the term “entrepreneurial course” and link it to the entrepreneurship process. Also, it would be useful to explore what are the results of EE programmes in terms of the actual graduates who start or grow a business, and link the findings to the teaching process. © 2015 The Author(s).

Green Software multi-sourcing is a modern research area which lies at the intersection of both the aforementioned research areas (Green Software Engineering and Software Multi-Sourcing). The goal of this paper is to present the systematic literature review (SLR) protocol which has been developed, validated and in the process of implementation. The implementation of the SLR protocol will yield in the identification of success/risk factors, and real-world green practices to be considered by multi-sourcing vendor organizations that can contribute towards the development of green and sustainable software. Systematic Literature Review procedure has been used as research practice. SLR is a new research method in software engineering which is dissimilar from conventional literature analysis. SLR is more comprehensive and is grounded on a pre-defined protocol. We have developed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol and are currently in the process of its implementation.

Over a decade of research on MDS has resulted in a large number of publications. Objective: To provide a detailed analysis of the state of the art in MDS, a systematic literature review (SLR) is essential. Method: We conducted an extensive SLR on MDS. Derived from our research questions, we designed a rigorous, extensive search and selection process to identify a set of primary MDS studies that is as complete as possible. Our three-pronged search process consists of automatic searching, manual searching, and snowballing. After discovering and considering more than thousand relevant papers, we identified, strictly selected, and reviewed 108 MDS publications. Results: The results of our SLR show the overall status of the key artefacts of MDS, and the identified primary MDS studies. For example, regarding security modelling artefact, we found that developing domain-specific languages plays a key role in many MDS approaches. The current limitations in each MDS artefact are pointed out and corresponding potential research directions are suggested. Moreover, we categorise the identified primary MDS studies into 5 significant MDS studies, and other emerging or less common MDS studies. Finally, some trend analyses of MDS research are given. Conclusion: Our results suggest the need for addressing multiple security concerns more systematically and simultaneously, for tool chains supporting the MDS development cycle, and for more empirical studies on the application of MDS methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this SLR is the first in the field of Software Engineering that combines a snowballing strategy with database searching.

Methods A total of 376 patients with SLE were assessed for the presence of the following: (i) confirmed AH, (ii) positive thy-roperoxidase/thyroglobulin antibodies [TPOAb/TgAb] without hypothyroidism, (iii) nonautoimmune hypothyroidism and (iv) SLE patients with neither. Multivariate analysis and a classification and regression tree model were used to analyse data. The current information was discussed through a systematic literature review (SLR). Results In our cohort, the prevalence of confirmed AH was 12%. However, in euthyroid patients with SLE, TPOAb and TgAb were observed in 21% and 10%, respectively. Patients with confirmed AH were significantly older and had later age at onset of the disease. Smoking (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 6·93, 95% CI 1·98-28·54, P = 0·004), Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) (AOR 23·2, 95% CI 1·89-359·53, P = 0·015) and positivity for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) (AOR 10·35, 95% CI 1·04-121·26, P = 0·047) were associated with AH-SLE, regardless of gender and duration of the disease. Smoking and SS were confirmed as predictors of AH-SLE. In the SLR, the prevalence of AITD ranged from 1% to 60%. The factors associated with this polyautoimmunity were female gender, older age, smoking, certain autoantibodies, SS, and cutaneous and articular involvement. Conclusions AITD is frequent in SLE and does not affect the severity of SLE. Identified risk factors will assist clinicians in the search for AITD. Our results encourage smoke-free policies in patients with SLE. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"antimalarial agent; autoantibody; azathioprine; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; cyclophosphamide; levothyroxine; mycophenolate mofetil; rituximab; steroid; thyroglobulin antibody; thyroid peroxidase; adult; antibody blood level; Article; autoimmune disease; autoimmune hypothyroidism; autoimmunity; Colombian; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; human; hypothyroidism; immunosuppressive treatment; major clinical study; male; middle aged; onset age; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; Sjoegren syndrome; smoking; smoking ban; steroid therapy; systemic lupus erythematosus; adolescent; complication; Hashimoto disease; hypothyroidism; multivariate analysis; pathology; physiology; systemic lupus erythematosus; Thyroiditis, Autoimmune; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Autoimmunity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hashimoto Disease; Humans; Hypothyroidism; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Thyroiditis, Autoimmune; Young Adult","Anaya, J.-M.; Center for Autoimmune Diseases Research (CREA), School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad Del Rosario, Carrera 24 No. 63C-69, Colombia; email: juan.anaya@urosario.edu.co",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",03000664,,CLENA,"25382266","English","Clin.

However, there is a lack of any performance assessment (PA) framework and related indicators for the PA. This study aimed to develop a PA framework and indicators in CDM in disasters. Methods In this study, a series of methods were used. First, a systematic literature review (SLR) was performed in order to extract the existing PA frameworks and indicators. Then, using a qualitative approach, some interviews with purposively selected experts were conducted and used in developing the PA framework and indicators. Finally, the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used for weighting of the developed indicators. Results The input, process, products, and outcomes (IPPO) framework was found to be an appropriate framework for CDM PA. Seven main functions were revealed to CDM during disasters. Forty PA indicators were developed for the four categories. Conclusion There is a lack of any existing PA framework in CDM in disasters. Thus, in this study, a PA framework (IPPO framework) was developed for the PA of CDM in disasters through a series of methods. It can be an appropriate framework and its indicators could measure the performance of CDM in disasters.

This paper presents a compilation of improvements, focused on increasing the accuracy of the FPA method, which have been proposed over the past 13 years. The methodology used was a systematic literature review (SLR), which was conducted with four research questions aligned with the objectives of this study. As a result of the SLR, of the 1600 results returned by the search engines, 454 primary studies were preselected according to the criteria established for the SLR. Among these studies, only 18 specifically referred to accuracy improvements for FPA, which was the goal of this study. The low number of studies that propose FPA improvements might demonstrate the maturity of the method in the current scenario of software metrics. Specifically in terms of found issues, it was found that the step for calculating the functional size exhibited the highest number of problems, indicating the need to revise FPA in order to encompass the possible improvements suggested by the researchers. © 1988-2012 IEEE.","Accuracy improvement; function point analysis (FPA); systematic literature review (SLR)","Accuracy Improvement; Function point analysis; International organizations; Research questions; Software metrics; Standardized methods; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Search engines",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00189391,,IEEMA,,"English","IEEE Trans Eng Manage",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960284185

The first objective is to identify the antecedents towards safety use of health IT by conducting systematic literature review (SLR). The second objective is to classify the identified antecedents based on the work system in Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model and an extension of DeLone and McLean (D&M) information system (IS) success model. Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted from peer-reviewed scholarly publications between January 2000 and July 2014. SLR was carried out and reported based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. The related articles were identified by searching the articles published in Science Direct, Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases. Data extracted from the resultant studies included are to be analysed based on the work system in Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS) model, and also from the extended DeLone and McLean (D&M) information system (IS) success model. Results: 55 articles delineated to be antecedents that influenced the safety use of health IT were included for review. Antecedents were identified and then classified into five key categories. The categories are (1) person, (2) technology, (3) tasks, (4) organization, and (5) environment. Specifically, person is attributed by competence while technology is associated to system quality, information quality, and service quality. Tasks are attributed by task-related stressor. Organisation is related to training, organisation resources, and teamwork. Lastly, environment is attributed by physical layout, and noise. Conclusions: This review provides evidence that the antecedents for safety use of health IT originated from both social and technical aspects. However, inappropriate health IT usage potentially increases the incidence of errors and produces new safety risks. The review cautions future implementation and adoption of health IT to carefully consider the complex interactions between social and technical elements propound in healthcare settings. © 2015.","Antecedents; Errors; Health IT; Patient safety; Socio-technical","Classification (of information); Data mining; Errors; Health; Health risks; Information systems; Safety engineering; Systems engineering; Antecedents; Health information technologies; Health it; Information system success model; Patient safety; Scholarly publication; Sociotechnical; Systematic literature review (SLR); Information use; Cinahl; electronic prescribing; Embase; human; information processing; information system; medical informatics; Medline; patient safety; priority journal; publication; Review; ScienceDirect; systematic review; technology; attitude to computers; electronic health record; health care quality; health personnel attitude; medical error; meta analysis (topic); organization and management; patient safety; prevention and control; procedures; standards; Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Computers; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Medical Errors; Medical Informatics; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Patient Safety; Quality of Health Care","Salahuddin, L.; Advanced Informatics School, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: lizawati22@live.utm.my",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",13865056,,IJMIF,"26238706","English","Int.

Without interventions that facilitate patient scheduling, improve attendance to provider appointments and provide patient information to provider and care team, preventive services cannot begin. This review examines interventions based upon three focus areas: 1) scheduling the patient with their provider; 2) getting the patient to their appointment, and; 3) having patient information integral to their diabetes care available to the provider. This study identifies interventions that improve appointment management and preparation as well as patient clinical and behavioral outcomes. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was performed using MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane library. Only articles in English and peer-reviewed articles were chosen. A total of 77 articles were identified that matched the three focus areas of the literature review: 1) on the schedule, 2) to the visit, and 3) patient information. These focus areas were utilized to analyze the literature to determine intervention trends and identify those with improved diabetes clinical and behavioral outcomes. Results: The articles included in this review were published between 1987 and 2013, with 46 of them published after 2006. Forty-two studies considered only Type 2 diabetes, 4 studies considered only Type 1 diabetes, 15 studies considered both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, and 16 studies did not mention the diabetes type. Thirty-five of the 77 studies in the review were randomized controlled studies. Interventions that facilitated scheduling patients involved phone reminders, letter reminders, scheduling when necessary while monitoring patients, and open access scheduling. Interventions used to improve attendance were letter reminders, phone reminders, short message service (SMS) reminders, and financial incentives. Interventions that enabled routine exchange of patient information included web-based programs, phone calls, SMS, mail reminders, decision support systems linked to evidence-based treatment guidelines, registries integrated with electronic medical records, and patient health records. Conclusions: The literature review showed that simple phone and letter reminders for scheduling or prompting of the date and time of an appointment to more complex web-based multidisciplinary programs with patient self-management can have a positive impact on clinical and behavioral outcomes for diabetes patients. Multifaceted interventions aimed at appointment management and preparation during various phases of the medical outpatient care process improves diabetes disease management. © 2015 Nuti et al.","Behavioral outcomes; Clinical outcomes; Diabetes; Interventions","adolescent; adult; aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; female; hospital management; human; male; methodology; middle aged; outcome assessment; self care; text messaging; United States; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Appointments and Schedules; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Research Design; Self Care; Text Messaging; United States; Young Adult","Turkcan, A.; Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Avenue, 334 Snell Engineering, United States",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",14726963,,,"26330299","English","BMC Health Serv.

They are ideal for achieving a wide geographic coverage of the target population, dealing with sensitive topics and are less resource-intensive than other data collection methods. These survey questionnaires can be delivered electronically, which can maximise the scalability and speed of data collection while reducing cost. In recent years, the use of apps running on consumer smart devices (i.e., smartphones and tablets) for this purpose has received considerable attention. However, variation in the mode of delivering a survey questionnaire could affect the quality of the responses collected. Objectives: To assess the impact that smartphone and tablet apps as a delivery mode have on the quality of survey questionnaire responses compared to any other alternative delivery mode: paper, laptop computer, tablet computer (manufactured before 2007), short message service (SMS) and plastic objects. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, IEEEXplore, Web of Science, CABI: CAB Abstracts, Current Contents Connect, ACM Digital, ERIC, Sociological Abstracts, Health Management Information Consortium, the Campbell Library and CENTRAL. We also searched registers of current and ongoing clinical trials such as ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also searched the grey literature in OpenGrey, Mobile Active and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses. Lastly, we searched Google Scholar and the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews. We performed all searches up to 12 and 13 April 2015. Selection criteria: We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), crossover trials and paired repeated measures studies that compared the electronic delivery of self-administered survey questionnaires via a smartphone or tablet app with any other delivery mode. We included data obtained from participants completing health-related self-administered survey questionnaire, both validated and non-validated. We also included data offered by both healthy volunteers and by those with any clinical diagnosis. We included studies that reported any of the following outcomes: data equivalence; data accuracy; data completeness; response rates; differences in the time taken to complete a survey questionnaire; differences in respondent's adherence to the original sampling protocol; and acceptability to respondents of the delivery mode. We included studies that were published in 2007 or after, as devices that became available during this time are compatible with the mobile operating system (OS) framework that focuses on apps. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data from the included studies using a standardised form created for this systematic review in REDCap. They then compared their forms to reach consensus. Through an initial systematic mapping on the included studies, we identified two settings in which survey completion took place: controlled and uncontrolled. These settings differed in terms of (i) the location where surveys were completed, (ii) the frequency and intensity of sampling protocols, and (iii) the level of control over potential confounders (e.g., type of technology, level of help offered to respondents). We conducted a narrative synthesis of the evidence because a meta-analysis was not appropriate due to high levels of clinical and methodological diversity. We reported our findings for each outcome according to the setting in which the studies were conducted. Main results: We included 14 studies (15 records) with a total of 2275 participants; although we included only 2272 participants in the final analyses as there were missing data for three participants from one included study. Regarding data equivalence, in both controlled and uncontrolled settings, the included studies found no significant differences in the mean overall scores between apps and other delivery modes, and that all correlation coefficients exceeded the recommended thresholds for data equivalence. Concerning the time taken to complete a survey questionnaire in a controlled setting, one study found that an app was faster than paper, whereas the other study did not find a significant difference between the two delivery modes. In an uncontrolled setting, one study found that an app was faster than SMS. Data completeness and adherence to sampling protocols were only reported in uncontrolled settings. Regarding the former, an app was found to result in more complete records than paper, and in significantly more data entries than an SMS-based survey questionnaire. Regarding adherence to the sampling protocol, apps may be better than paper but no different from SMS. We identified multiple definitions of acceptability to respondents, with inconclusive results: preference; ease of use; willingness to use a delivery mode; satisfaction; effectiveness of the system informativeness; perceived time taken to complete the survey questionnaire; perceived benefit of a delivery mode; perceived usefulness of a delivery mode; perceived ability to complete a survey questionnaire; maximum length of time that participants would be willing to use a delivery mode; and reactivity to the delivery mode and its successful integration into respondents' daily routine. Finally, regardless of the study setting, none of the included studies reported data accuracy or response rates. Authors' conclusions: Our results, based on a narrative synthesis of the evidence, suggest that apps might not affect data equivalence as long as the intended clinical application of the survey questionnaire, its intended frequency of administration and the setting in which it was validated remain unchanged. There were no data on data accuracy or response rates, and findings on the time taken to complete a self-administered survey questionnaire were contradictory. Furthermore, although apps might improve data completeness, there is not enough evidence to assess their impact on adherence to sampling protocols. None of the included studies assessed how elements of user interaction design, survey questionnaire design and intervention design might influence mode effects. Those conducting research in public health and epidemiology should not assume that mode effects relevant to other delivery modes apply to apps running on consumer smart devices. Those conducting methodological research might wish to explore the issues highlighted by this systematic review. © 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Alignment is a key factor for success in many software development projects. Aligned teams are capable of bringing collaboration and positive results to companies; whereas misalignment among developers can make a conflicted environment and even lead the project to failure. OBJECTIVE. To assist developers in an embedded software development company in their conceptual alignment regarding source code quality. METHOD. In the organizational context, plan and perform a series of studies such as surveys, systematic literature review (SLR), qualitative data analysis and focus group to support the identification of conceptual misalignments among developers and establish common terminology and guidance concerning source code quality. RESULTS. The results from a survey conducted in one company showed a conceptual misalignment among developers regarding the source code quality that was triggering continuous rework during software evolution activities. Through an SLR and a qualitative analysis of code snippets, a set of evidence-based coding guidelines for readability and understandability of source code were formulated. These guidelines were evaluated and used as an instrument for aligning source code perspectives during a focus group, showing their feasibility and adequacy to the company's context. CONCLUSIONS. The use of all contextual information observed-e.g. teams' locations, software development context, and time constraints-along with the information gathered during the industry-academia collaboration was particularly important to help us appropriately chose research methods to be used, and formulate evidence-based coding guidelines that matched the company's needs and expectations. Further evaluations have to be carried out to ensure the quality impact of some guidelines proposed before using them all over the company. © 2015 IEEE.","code quality; conceptual alignment; experimental studies; industry-academia collaboration","Alignment; Codes (symbols); Computer programming languages; Software design; Surveys; Code quality; Contextual information; experimental studies; Organizational context; Qualitative data analysis; Software development projects; Source code qualities; Systematic literature review (SLR); Quality control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479919345,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Mechanical staple lines are essential for gastrointestinal surgery such as bariatric surgery. However, SLC, such as bleeding and leakage, still occur. The purposes of this study were to provide quantitative evidence on the relative efficacy of gastric SLR and to compare the rates of effectiveness of three commonly used methods. Methods: A search of the medical literature in English language journals identified studies from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2013, using the following reinforcement types: (1) no reinforcement, (2) oversewing, (3) a biocompatible glycolide copolymer, and (4) bovine pericardium after gastric bypasses and sleeve gastrectomies. Types of reinforcement were compared using a random-effects model. Results: This meta-analysis reviewed 16,967 articles, extracting data on 56,309 patients concerning leak and 41,864 patients concerning bleeding. Over 40 % of patients had no reinforcement, resulting in the highest leak rate (2.75 %) and bleed rate (3.45 %). Overall, reinforcing with bovine pericardium had the lowest leak (1.28 %) and bleed (1.23 %) rates. Suture oversewing was better than no reinforcement but not as effective as bovine pericardium for leak (2.45 %) and bleed (2.69 %) rates. Buttressing with a biocompatible glycolide copolymer resulted in the second highest leak rate (2.61 %) and a bleed rate of 2.48 % but had significantly lower bleed rates than no reinforcement. Conclusions: SLR provided superior results for patients compared to no reinforcement for reducing SLC. Buttressing with bovine pericardium resulted in the most favorable outcomes. The effectiveness of different methods used to reinforce the staple line in gastric surgery does not appear to be equal. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Bioabsorbable glycolide copolymer; Bovine pericardium; Staple line bleed; Staple line buttress; Staple line leak; Staple line oversewing; Staple lines","copolymer; Article; bariatric surgery; bovine; clinical effectiveness; gastric staple line reinforcement; gastrointestinal stapler; gastrointestinal surgery; human; meta analysis; morbid obesity; nonhuman; pericardium; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; sleeve gastrectomy; stomach bypass; systematic review; adverse effects; animal; devices; gastrectomy; gastric bypass surgery; laparoscopy; Obesity, Morbid; pathology; procedures; risk assessment; stomach; surgical stapling; suture; transplantation; Animals; Bariatric Surgery; Cattle; Gastrectomy; Gastric Bypass; Humans; Laparoscopy; Obesity, Morbid; Pericardium; Risk Assessment; Stomach; Surgical Stapling; Sutures","Shikora, S.A.; Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, 75 Francis Street, ASB II, United States; email: sshikora@partners.org",,"Springer New York LLC",09608923,,OBSUE,"25968078","English","Obes.

In response, universities are developing courses and curricula around GSE and researchers have begun to disseminate studies of these new approaches. Problem: GSE differs from most other computer science fields, however, in that practice is inseparable from theory. As a result, educators looking to create GSE courses face a daunting task: integrating global practice into the local classroom. Aim: This study aims to ameliorate the very difficult task of teaching GSE by delineating the challenges and providing some recommendations for overcoming them. Method: To meet our aims we pose two research questions (""When teaching GSE to students in Higher Education, what are the (a) challenges, and (b) recommendations for addressing them"") and then conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to determine the answers to these questions. Our SLR follows a carefully designed and validated protocol. Results: We found 82 papers that addressed our research questions. Our findings indicate that in addition to the challenges posed by GSE in general, particular problems arise in educational situations. The majority of these challenges fall into the ""global distance"" category, though teamwork challenges and people issues (such as trust) also commonly arise. Organizational differences between institutions, differing skill sets between students in different locations, and varying cultural work norms, for example, all operate within educational settings in quite different ways than in professional development teams. Integrating cultural training, conducting teamwork exercises to build trust, and instructor monitoring of team communication are all examples of techniques that have been used successfully by educators according to our review Conclusion: Despite the severity of the challenges in GSE education, many institutions have successfully developed courses and curricula targeting GSE. Indeed, for each of the challenges we have identified in the literature there are numerous recommendations for overcoming them. Instructors can use the recommendations given in this study as a starting point to running successful GSE courses. © 2015 ACM.","Capstone; Global software development; Global software engineering; International collaboration; Open ended group project; Systematic literature review; Teaching and learning","Computer software; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; International cooperation; Personnel training; Societies and institutions; Software design; Software engineering; Students; Teaching; Capstone; Global software development; Global software engineering; International collaborations; Open-Ended Group Projects; Systematic literature review; Teaching and learning; Curricula",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450341462,,,"English","ITiCSE-WGP - Proc.

The major concern is now shifting towards the maintenance and evolution of service-based business information systems. Moreover, these systems are highly dynamic and frequent changes are anticipated across multiple levels of abstraction. Impact analysis and change propagation are identified as potential research areas in this regard. Objective The aim of this study is to systematically review extant research on impact analysis and propagation in the BPM and SOA domains. Identifying, categorizing and synthesizing relevant solutions are the main study objectives. Method Through careful review and screening, we identified 60 studies relevant to 4 research questions. Two classification schemes served to comprehend and analyze the anatomy of existing solutions. BPM is considered at the business level for business operations and processes, while SOA is considered at the service level as deployment architecture. We focused on both horizontal and vertical impacts of changes across multiple abstraction layers. Results Impact analysis solutions were mainly divided into dependency analysis, traceability analysis and history mining. Dependency analysis is the most frequently adopted technique followed by traceability analysis. Further categorization of dependency analysis indicates that graph-based techniques are extensively used, followed by formal dependency modeling. While considering hierarchical coverage, inter-process and inter-service change analyses have received considerable attention from the research community, whereas bottom-up analysis has been the most neglected research area. The majority of change propagation solutions are top-down and semi-automated. Conclusions This study concludes with new insight suggestions for future research. Although, the evolution of service-based systems is becoming of grave concern, existing solutions in this field are less mature. Studies on hierarchical change impact are scarce. Complex relationships of services with business processes and semantic dependencies are poorly understood and require more attention from the research community. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","BPM; Change propagation; CIA; Dependency analysis; MSR; Semantic annotation; SOA; SOC; Systematic literature review (SLR); Web service","Abstracting; Administrative data processing; Enterprise resource management; Graphic methods; Information services; Semantics; Solution mining; System-on-chip; Web services; Business information systems; Business process management; Change propagation; Dependency analysis; Deployment architecture; Semantic annotations; Service oriented enterprise; Systematic literature review (SLR); Service oriented architecture (SOA)","Akhunzada, A.; Centre for Mobile Cloud Computing Research (C4MCCR), Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, University of MalayaMalaysia; email: a.adnan@siswa.um.edu.my",,"Elsevier Ltd",03064379,,INSYD,,"English","Inf.

The purpose of this review was to analyse the safety of RS in paediatric patients with haemophilia and provide a risk-benefit assessment, which practitioners could apply to their patients. Children undergoing knee RS receive a radiation dose of approximately 0.74 mSv (90 megabecquerels-MBq) and elbow and ankle RSs a dose of approximately 0.32 mSv (30-40 MBq). The radiation dose from natural sources is approximately 2 mSv and the recommended limit for patients (apart from natural sources) is 1 mSv per year. The lifetime cancer risk increases about 0.5% per 100 mSv per year. Considering the risks and benefits of RS, the authors recommend that clinicians consider this procedure in children with inhibitors or in patients without inhibitors when bleeding is recurrent and persistent despite aggressive factor replacement. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd214 July 2015 10.1111/hae.12668 Review Article Review Articles © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Children; Haemophilia; Radiation exposure; Radiosynovectomy; Synovitis","blood clotting factor; chitosan ho 166; chromium phosphate p 32; gold 198; hydroxyapatite sm 153; phosphorus 32; radioisotope; rhenium 186; samarium 153; unclassified drug; yttrium 90; phosphorus; radiopharmaceutical agent; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; bacterial arthritis; cancer risk; childhood disease; chromosome aberration; genotoxicity; hemarthrosis; hemophilia; human; joint swelling; priority journal; quality of life; radiation dose; radiation exposure; radiation safety; radiosynovectomy; radiotherapy; range of motion; Review; risk assessment; risk benefit analysis; synovectomy; synovitis; systematic review; treatment outcome; chemistry; complication; hemophilia A; joint characteristics and functions; knee; pathophysiology; radiation exposure; radiography; synovitis; Hemophilia A; Humans; Knee Joint; Phosphorus Radioisotopes; Radiation Exposure; Radiopharmaceuticals; Range of Motion, Articular; Synovitis","Rodriguez-Merchan, E.C.; Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, La Paz University Hospital, Paseo de la Castellana 261, Spain",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13518216,,HAEMF,"25854422","English","Haemophilia",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931957151

These issues are specifically addressed by so-called systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that propose a strict protocol for the search and appraisal of literature. Moreover, SLRs are claimed to be a 'standardized method' for literature reviews that is replicable, transparent, objective, unbiased and rigorous, and thus superior to other approaches for conducting literature reviews. These are significant and consequential claims that - despite increasing adoption of SLRs - remained largely unnoticed in the information systems (IS) literature. The objective of this debate is to draw attention of the IS community to SLR's claims, to question their justification and reveal potential risks of their adoption. This is achieved by first examining the origins of SLR and the prescribed SLR process and then by critically assessing their claims and implications. In this debate, we show that SLRs are applicable and useful for a very specific kind of literature review, a meta study that identifies and summarizes evidence from earlier research. We also demonstrate that the claims that SLRs provide superior quality are not justified. More importantly, we argue that SLR as a general approach to conducting literature reviews is highly questionable, concealing significant perils. The paper cautions that SLR could undermine critical engagement with literature and what it means to be scholarly in academic work. © 2015 JIT Palgrave Macmillan.","conducting literature reviews; database searches; literature review; literature search; narrative literature review; systematic literature review (SLR); systematic review","Database searches; Literature reviews; Literature search; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Search engines","Boell, S.K.; Discipline of Business Information Systems, The University of Sydney Business SchoolAustralia",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",02683962,,,,"English","J.

Methods: A multidisciplinary task force, representing 10 European countries, formulated a definition for PE and 10 research questions that guided a systematic literature review (SLR). The results from the SLR were discussed and used as a basis for developing the recommendations, a research agenda and an educational agenda. The recommendations were categorised according to level and strength of evidence graded from A (highest) to D (lowest). Task force members rated their agreement with each recommendation from 0 (total disagreement) to 10 (total agreement). Results: Based on the SLR and expert opinions, eight recommendations were developed, four with strength A evidence. The recommendations addressed when and by whom PE should be offered, modes and methods of delivery, theoretical framework, outcomes and evaluation. A high level of agreement was achieved for all recommendations (mean range 9.4-9.8). The task force proposed a research agenda and an educational agenda. Conclusions: The eight evidence-based and expert opinion-based recommendations for PE for people with inflammatory arthritis are intended to provide a core framework for the delivery of PE and training for health professionals in delivering PE across Europe. © 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

The aim of this study is to investigate the association of this antibody with clinical and serological disorders in SLE. Methods: All relevant literature was retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI databases. The qualities of these studies were evaluated using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The associations of anti-P antibody with clinical and serological disorders were determined by the pooled odds ratio (OR) and the confidence interval (CI) calculated using meta-analysis with the Mantel-Haenszel method. Results: Sixteen cohort studies with 2355 patients were included in this study. Malar rash, oral ulcer and photosensitivity were strongly associated with serum anti-P antibody, with OR (95% CI) values of 2.05 (1.42-2.92), 1.49 (1.05-2.13) and 1.44 (1.08-1.91), respectively. Arthritis and renal involvement were not associated with anti-P antibody, whereas a high heterogeneity was observed due to ethnicity and publication bias, respectively. Neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE), hepatic involvement, anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were observed more frequently in anti-P positive patients than in negative patients. Studies on hepatic involvement showed a low precision with substantially broad CI (2.56-11.2). A high heterogeneity presented among studies on NPSLE, anti-Sm and aCL. Conclusions: Anti-P antibody is significantly associated with malar rash, oral ulcer, photosensitivity and serum anti-dsDNA antibody, and potentially associated with NPSLE, hepatic damage, serum anti-Sm and aCL. © The Author(s), 2014.","anti-ribosomal P (anti-P) antibody; Meta-analysis; systemic lupus erythematosus","cardiolipin antibody; double stranded DNA antibody; protein antibody; ribosome protein; ribosome protein antibody; Sm antibody; unclassified drug; autoantibody; biological marker; ribosome protein; African American; antibody blood level; arthritis; Article; Asian; clinical feature; cohort analysis; correlation analysis; ethnicity; European; human; kidney disease; liver injury; malar rash; meta analysis; mouth ulcer; photosensitivity; priority journal; rash; serology; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; blood; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; immunoblotting; immunology; odds ratio; pathology; procedures; psychology; systemic lupus erythematosus; Autoantibodies; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Humans; Immunoblotting; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Odds Ratio; Ribosomal Proteins","Wang, L.107 Yanjiang Rd W, China",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",09612033,,LUPUE,"25406488","English","Lupus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928007087

However, stakeholders have little guidance for choosing fitting definitions and metrics for these quality properties, thus leading to potential misunderstandings. For example, cloud consumers and providers cannot negotiate reliable and quantitative service level objectives directly understood by each stakeholder. Objectives: Therefore, we examine existing definitions and metrics for these quality properties from the viewpoint of cloud consumers, cloud providers, and software architects with regard to commonly used concepts. Methods: We execute a systematic literature review (SLR), reproducibly collecting common concepts in definitions and metrics for scalability, elasticity, and efficiency. As quality selection criteria, we assess whether existing literature differentiates the three properties, exemplifies metrics, and considers typical cloud characteristics and cloud roles. Results: Our SLR yields 418 initial results from which we select 20 for in-depth evaluation based on our quality selection criteria. In our evaluation, we recommend concepts, definitions, and metrics for each property. Conclusions: Software architects can use our recommendations to analyze the quality of cloud computing applications.

While many relevant studies have been carried out to evaluate various capture-recapture models and estimators, there still lacks common understanding on the adoption status of the method in software engineering. It is necessary to systematically collect empirical evidence of Capture-recapture adoption hence form necessary under- standing on the method. Objective: This study aims to synthesize relevant primary studies on the adoption of capture-recapture method in soft- ware engineering, and try to identify possible gaps between the state-of-practice and the state-of-art so as to provide clues for future research. Method: By following the guidelines of Kitchenham, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review(SLR) on studies of the adoption of capture-recapture method in software en- gineering. Results: From 5 common digital libraries, we retrieved 506 published articles, among them 44 were identified as relevant primary studies. We identified 18 capture-recapture estima- tors under 4 basic models. Types of the currently existing studies as well as the relevant in uencing factors to adoption of the capture-recapture method are also discussed. Conclusion: Results show that there are no conclusive de- cisions on the best capture-recapture models and estimators.

However, to date there are no studies on the state of the practice in this area, focusing on similar issues to those investigated in the above-mentioned SLR. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to report on the state of the practice on effort estimation in ASD, focusing on a wide range of aspects such as the estimation techniques and effort predictors used, to name a few. Method: A survey was carried out using as instrument an on-line questionnaire answered by agile practitioners who have experience in effort estimation. Results: Data was collected from 60 agile practitioners from 16 different countries, and the main findings are: 1) Planning poker (63%), analogy (47%) and expert judgment (38%) are frequently practiced estimation techniques in ASD; 2) Story points is the most frequently (62%) employed size metric, used solo or in combination with other metrics (e.g., function points); 3) Team's expertise level and prior experience are most commonly used cost drivers; 4) 52% of the respondents believe that their effort estimates on average are under/over estimated by an error of 25% or more; 5) Most agile teams take into account implementation and testing activities during effort estimation; and 6) Estimation is mostly performed at sprint and release planning levels in ASD. Conclusions: Estimation techniques that rely on experts' subjective assessment are the ones used the most in ASD, with effort underestimation being the dominant trend. Further, the use of multiple techniques in combination and story points seem to present a positive association with estimation accuracy, and team-related cost drivers are the ones used by most agile teams. Finally, requirements and management related issues are perceived as the main reasons for inaccurate estimates.

Following key terms were used either in single or in combination such as ""Chronic Disease Model"" AND ""Diabetes Mellitus"" OR ""COPD"" OR ""CVD"".RESULTS: A total of 23 studies were included in the final analysis. Majority of the studies were US-based. Five chronic disease models included Chronic Care Model (CCM), Improving Chronic Illness Care (ICIC), and Innovative Care for Chronic Conditions (ICCC), Stanford Model (SM) and Community based Transition Model (CBTM). CCM was the most studied model. Elements studied included delivery system design and self-management support (87%), clinical information system and decision support (57%) and health system organization (52%). Elements including center care on the patient and family (13%), patient safety (4%), community policies (4%), built integrated health care (4%) and remote patient monitoring (4%) have not been well studied. Other elements including support paradigm shift, manage political environment, align sectoral policies for health, use healthcare personnel more effectively, support patients in their communities, emphasize prevention, identify patient specific concerns related to the transition process, and health literacy between visits and treatments have also not been well studied in the existing literature.CONCLUSIONS: It was unclear to what extent the results generated is applicable to different populations and locations and therefore is an area of future research.

The paper highlights the major gaps in the existing studies on behavioural biases. It also aims to raise specific questions for future research. Design/methodology/approach – We employ systematic literature review (SLR) method in the present study. The prominence of research is assessed by studying the year of publication, journal of publication, country of study, types of statistical method, citation analysis and content analysis on the literature on behavioural biases. The present study is based on 117 selected articles published in peer- review journals between 1980 and 2013. Findings – Much of the existing literature on behavioural biases indicates the limited research in emerging economies in this area, the dominance of secondary data-based empirical research, the lack of empirical research on individuals who exhibit herd behaviour, the focus on equity in home bias, and indecisive empirical findings on herding bias. Research limitations/implications – This study focuses on individuals’ behavioural biases in investment decision-making. Our aim is to analyse the impact of cognitive biases on trading behaviour, volatility, market returns and portfolio selection. Originality/value – The paper covers a considerable period of time (1980-2013). To the best of authors’ knowledge, this study is the first using systematic literature review method in the area of behavioural finance and also the first to examine a combination of four different biases involved in investment decision-making. This paper will be useful to researchers, academicians and those working in the area of behavioural finance in understanding the impact of behavioural biases on investment decision-making. © 2015, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Behavioural biases; Disposition effect; Herding; Home bias; Overconfidence",,"Kumar, S.; Management Studies department, Malaviya National Institute of TechnologyIndia; email: scholar.satish@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17554179,,,,"English","Qual.

EA is managed, developed, and maintained throughout the EA Implementation Methodology (EAIM). Objective: The aims of this study are to identify the existing effective practices that are used by existing EAIMs, identify the factors that affect the effectiveness of EAIM, identify the current tools that are used by existing EAIMs, and identify the open problems and areas related to EAIM for improvement. Method: A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out. 669 papers were retrieved by a manual search in 6 databases and 46 primary studies were finally included. Result: From these studies 33% were journal articles, 41% were conference papers while 26% were contributions from the studies consisted of book chapters. Consequently, 28 practices, 19 factors, and 15 tools were identified and analysed. Conclusion: Several rigorous researches have been done in order to provide effective EAIM, however there are still problems in components of EAIM, including: there is lack of tool support for whole part of EA implementation, there are deficiency in addressing the EAIM's practices especially in modeling, management, and maintenance, there is lack of consideration on non-functional requirement in existing EAIM, there is no appropriate consideration on requirement analysis in most existing EAIM. This review provides researchers with some guidelines for future research on this topic. It also provides broad information on EAIM, which could be useful for practitioners. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The objective of this paper is to compare formal SLRs and informal literature reviews in software engineering. For this purpose, a SLR has been conducted to compare the results with a previously conducted informal literature review of software process improvement success factors. Previous research using an informal literature review approach found 47 articles via the snow balling technique. For formal literature reviews, the SLR was conducted by applying customised search strings covering the time to 30 June 2004 (this is the deadline of the informal literature review). In total, 38 relevant articles were identified via the formal literature review. The results show that the data extraction process in the formal literature review enabled more success factors to be extracted (i.e. 34) than the informal literature review (i.e. 18). In the formal literature review, the publication inclusion and exclusion criteria and selecting primary studies helped in identifying the right list of publications. A real challenge in the formal literature review was to define a search string. In general it was observed that the SLR methodology is better than the informal literature review with respect to the planning for literature review, the design of search string, sources to be searched, publication inclusion and exclusion criteria, publication quality assessment and the data extraction process. However, the informal literature review has identified more articles than the formal literature review. Snow balling technique should be used with the formal literature review in order to identify all the relevant articles. © 2015, King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals.","Critical success factors; Evidence-based software engineering; Software process improvement",,"Niazi, M.; Information and Computer Science Department, King Fahd University of Petroleum and MineralsSaudi Arabia; email: mkniazi@kfupm.edu.sa",,"Springer Verlag",2193567X,,,,"English","Arab.

The objective of this paper is to conduct the systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the most frequently used SN for reporting and analyzing the real-time events worldwide. Furthermore, we recognize the features and techniques used for mining the real-time events from SNs. To determine the literature related to event mining (EM) and SNs, the SLR process has been used. The SLR searching phase resulted 692 total studies from different online databases that went through three phases of screening, and finally 145 papers out of 692 were chosen to include in this SLR as per inclusion criteria and RQs. Based on the data analysis of the selected 145 studies, this paper has concluded that the Twitter microblogging SN is the most used SN to repot the events in textual format. The most common features used are n-gram and TF-IDF. Results also showed that support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) are the most frequently used techniques for SNEM. This SLR presents the list of SNs, features, and techniques that are reporting the SN events that can be helpful for other researchers for selection of SNs and techniques for their research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","Event mining (EM); Social networks (SNs); Social networks event mining (SNEM); Systematic literature review (SLR); Twitter","Support vector machines; Common features; Event mining; Microblogging; Online database; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Textual format; Twitter; Social networking (online)","Shaikh, M.; Department of Computer Science, Kulliyah of Information and Communication Technology, International Islamic University MalaysiaMalaysia; email: muniba.shaikh@live.iium.edu.my","Abraham A.Muda A.K.Choo Y.-H.","Springer Verlag",21945357,9783319173979,,,"English","Adv.

Objective: This study seeks to evaluate, synthesize, and present aspects of research on agile methods tailoring including the method tailoring approaches adopted and the criteria used for agile practice selection. Method: The method adopted was a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on studies published from 2002 to 2014. Results: 56 out of 783 papers have been identified as describing agile method tailoring approaches. These studies have been identified as case studies regarding the empirical research, as solution proposals regarding the research type, and as evaluation studies regarding the research validation type. Most of the papers used method engineering to implement tailoring and were not specific to any agile method on their scope. Conclusion: Most of agile methods tailoring research papers proposed or improved a technique, were implemented as case studies analyzing one case in details and validated their findings using evaluation. Method engineering was the base for tailoring, the approaches are independent of agile method and the main criteria used are internal environment and objectives variables. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines. Objective To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment). Results In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given. Conclusion The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone.

Based Adaptation (EBA) is integrated with coastal planning. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology is applied in this study. Attention was given to studies concerning human-environment interactions as opposed to physical or biological climate change issues alone because the coastal planning and EBA approach addresses the management of human actions in nature. The literature references include the issue of climate change (77%); however, limited evidence of EBA in coastal areas are reported (18%), and it is evident that the issues have become relevant in the scientific literature published in recent years. Broad texts demonstrate that SLR is one of the major long-term impacts (68%), and all of these papers recognize the most affected ecosystems in the tropics would be mangroves. EBA is an emerging option that can offset anticipated ecosystem losses and improve coastal planning to cope with SLR because it provides benefits beyond climate change stressors. There is a need to synthesize a road map for incorporation of mangrove regulations into local planning instruments and for building capacity for their implementation. Application of PRISMA in marine science will enhance future reviews, facilitate the systematic search and adequately document any theme, and also be useful in determining research gaps or information needs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Coastal planning; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Mangrove; Sea-level rise; Systematic Literature review","adaptive management; capacity building; climate change; coastal zone management; ecosystem management; environmental issue; environmental planning; literature review; mangrove; meta-analysis; nature-society relations; sea level change","Sierra-Correa, P.C.; Coastal Zone Management Research Program, Marine and Coastal Research Institute (INVEMAR), Calle 25 #2-55 Playa Salguero, Colombia",,"Elsevier Ltd",0308597X,,,,"English","Mar.

A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a research method used to identify the literature through the application of a rigorous protocol that ensures transparency of the process and increases validity of the work. While a SLR identifies and characterizes the literature, the next step to comprehensively understanding the research area is to synthesize the content of relevant previous work. There are many approaches to research synthesis including meta-analysis and meta-synthesis. Both analysis methods have the same constraint - they are limited by characteristics of the current literature. In organizational research, this presents a significant challenge due to the variety of disciplines typically participating in this research and the lack of consistency in reporting research findings. In addition, the literature in these fields tends to include both qualitative and quantitative studies, further complicating the synthesis.

Objective In this paper, a systematic literature review (SLR) has been conducted, and the results are compared with the previously collected data of SPI implementation success factors. The overarching objective of this research is to gain an in-depth understanding of success factors that play a positive role in SPI implementation; this will assist SPI managers in better designing and managing SPI programs. We are interested to discover if there are any differences in the success factors identified by the three research strategies used, that is, informal literature review, SLR, and interviews. Method Data were collected and analyzed using the three research strategies. For informal literature review, the snowballing technique was used. The SLR was conducted for formal literature reviews. For an empirical study, interviews were conducted with Australian SPI practitioners. Results Results show that (i) senior management commitment and (ii) staff involvement are the frequently cited common SPI success factors in all three research strategies. The results also uncover similarities and differences among the three research strategies regarding the importance of the SPI success factors: (i) SPI awareness is a frequently cited common SPI success factor in interviews and formal literature review, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is r<inf>s</inf>(37) = 0.413, p = 0.011; (ii) reviews are a frequently cited common SPI success factor in formal and informal literature reviews, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is r<inf>s</inf>(37) = 0.517, p = 0.001; and (iii) training and mentoring is a frequently cited common SPI success factor in interviews and an informal literature review, and the Spearman's rank-order correlation is r<inf>s</inf>(37) = 0.195, p = 0.247.

To cope with this business process variability, the proper management of process variants along the entire process lifecycle becomes crucial. Objective: The goal of this paper is to develop a fundamental understanding of business process variability. In particular, the paper will provide a framework for assessing and comparing process variability approaches and the support they provide for the different phases of the business process lifecycle (i.e., process analysis and design, configuration, enactment, diagnosis, and evolution). Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) in order to discover how process variability is supported by existing approaches. Results: The SLR resulted in 63 primary studies which were deeply analyzed. Based on this analysis, we derived the VIVACE framework. VIVACE allows assessing the expressiveness of a process modeling language regarding the explicit specification of process variability. Furthermore, the support provided by a process-aware information system to properly deal with process model variants can be assessed with VIVACE as well. Conclusions: VIVACE provides an empirically-grounded framework for process engineers that enables them to evaluate existing process variability approaches as well as to select that variability approach meeting their requirements best. Finally, it helps process engineers in implementing PAISs supporting process variability along the entire process lifecycle. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These approaches usually include many rules and guidelines which are very often implicit or scattered over different publications. Hence, for the practitioners it is not always easy to select and use these rules to support the decision making process. Even in case the rules are known, the lack of automated support for storing and executing the rules seriously impedes the decision making process. Objective We aim to evaluate the impact of a decision support system (DSS) on decision-making in SPLE adoption. In alignment with this goal, we provide a decision support model (DSM) and the corresponding DSS. Method First, we apply a systematic literature review (SLR) on the existing primary studies that discuss and present approaches for analyzing the feasibility of SPLE adoption and transition strategies. Second, based on the data extraction and synthesis activities of the SLR, the required questions and rules are derived and implemented in the DSS. Third, for validation of the approach we conduct multiple case studies. Results In the course of the SLR, 31 primary studies were identified from which we could construct 25 aspects, 39 questions and 312 rules. We have developed the DSS tool Transit-PL that embodies these elements. Conclusions The multiple case study validation showed that the adoption of the developed DSS tool is justified to support the decision making process in SPLE adoption. ©2015 Elsevier B.V.

Agile literature proposes a few key metrics but little is known of the actual metrics use in Agile teams. Objective: The objective of this paper is to increase knowledge of the reasons for and effects of using metrics in industrial Agile development. We focus on the metrics that Agile teams use, rather than the ones used from outside by software engineering researchers. In addition, we analyse the influence of the used metrics. Method: This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on using metrics in industrial Agile software development. We identified 774 papers, which we reduced to 30 primary studies through our paper selection process. Results: The results indicate that the reasons for and the effects of using metrics are focused on the following areas: sprint planning, progress tracking, software quality measurement, fixing software process problems, and motivating people. Additionally, we show that although Agile teams use many metrics suggested in the Agile literature, they also use many custom metrics. Finally, the most influential metrics in the primary studies are Velocity and Effort estimate. Conclusion: The use of metrics in Agile software development is similar to Traditional software development. Projects and sprints need to be planned and tracked. Quality needs to be measured. Problems in the process need to be identified and fixed. Future work should focus on metrics that had high importance but low prevalence in our study, as they can offer the largest impact to the software industry. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Eye-trackers monitor participants' visual attention by collecting eye-movement data. These data are useful to get insights into participants' cognitive processes during reasoning tasks. Objective The Evidence-based Software Engineering (EBSE) paradigm has been proposed in 2004 and, since then, has been used to provide detailed insights regarding different topics in software engineering research and practice. Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) are also useful in the context of EBSE by bringing together all existing evidence of research and results about a particular topic. This SLR evaluates the current state of the art of using eye-trackers in software engineering and provides evidence on the uses and contributions of eye-trackers to empirical studies in software engineering. Method We perform a SLR covering eye-tracking studies in software engineering published from 1990 up to the end of 2014. To search all recognised resources, instead of applying manual search, we perform an extensive automated search using Engineering Village. We identify 36 relevant publications, including nine journal papers, two workshop papers, and 25 conference papers. Results The software engineering community started using eye-trackers in the 1990s and they have become increasingly recognised as useful tools to conduct empirical studies from 2006. We observe that researchers use eye-trackers to study model comprehension, code comprehension, debugging, collaborative interaction, and traceability. Moreover, we find that studies use different metrics based on eye-movement data to obtain quantitative measures.

Objective - The objective of this study is to identify the challenges of the existing tools used in GSD projects. Method - The authors applied the systematic literature review (SLR) approach and a survey-based empirical study approach to address the research objective. Results - From both data sets, the authors identified eight challenges of the existing tools used in GSD projects. The top-ranked challenges in the SLR are the 'inappropriate use of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools' and 'difficulties in adopting and learning to use the existing tools'. The top-ranked challenges in the questionnaire-based empirical study are the 'lack of awareness of existing tools used in GSD projects' and the 'lack of support for collaboration and group decision making'. The results show a weak negative correlation between the ranks obtained from the SLR and the questionnaire-based empirical study ((rs(8) = -0.313), p = 0.450) Conclusion: GSD organisations should address the challenges of the existing tools used in GSD projects, especially the most common ones. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2015.",,"Decision making; Software design; Surveys; Empirical investigation; Global software development; Group Decision Making; High-quality software; Negative correlation; Research objectives; Synchronous and asynchronous communications; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software engineering","Niazi, M.; King Fahd University of Petroleum and MineralsSaudi Arabia",,"Institution of Engineering and Technology",17518806,,,,"English","IET Software",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84943236561

Objective We aim to analyze the impact of the experience curve effect on the Return on Investment (ROI) in the software product line engineering (SPLE) process. Method We first present the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) to explicitly depict the studies that have considered the impact of experience curve effect on software development in general. Subsequently, based on the results of the SLR, the experience curve effect models in the literature, and the SPLE cost models, we define an approach for extending the cost models with the experience curve effect. Finally, we discuss the application of the refined cost models in a real industrial context. Results The SLR resulted in 15 primary studies which confirm the impact of experience curve effect on software development in general but the experience curve effect in the adoption of SPLE got less attention. The analytical discussion of the cost models and the application of the refined SPLE cost models in the industrial context showed a clear impact of the experience curve effect on the time-to-market, cost of development and ROI in the SPLE adoption process. Conclusions The proposed analysis with the newly defined cost models for SPLE adoption provides a more precise analysis tool for the management, and as such helps to support a better decision making. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However when the researchers have evaluated the user involvement and system success (UI-SS) relationship empirically, the results were not always positive. Objective: Our objective was to explore the UI-SS relationship by synthesizing the results of all the studies that have empirically investigated this complex phenomenon. Method: We performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) following the steps provided in the guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. From the resulting studies we extracted data to answer our 9 research questions related to the UI-SS relationship, identification of users, perspectives of UI, benefits, problems and challenges of UI, degree and level of UI, relevance of stages of software development lifecycle (SDLC) and the research method employed on the UI-SS relationship. Results: Our systematic review resulted in selecting 87 empirical studies published during the period 1980-2012. Among 87 studies reviewed, 52 reported that UI positively contributes to system success, 12 suggested a negative contribution and 23 were uncertain. The UI-SS relationship is neither direct nor binary, and there are various confounding factors that play their role. The identification of users, their degree/level of involvement, stage of SDLC for UI, and choice of research method have been claimed to have impact on the UI-SS relationship. However, there is not sufficient empirical evidence available to support these claims. Conclusion: Our results have revealed that UI does contribute positively to system success. But it is a double edged sword and if not managed carefully it may cause more problems than benefits. Based on the analysis of 87 studies, we were able to identify factors for effective management of UI alluding to the causes for inconsistency in the results of published literature. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Basically, IT governance is a process or a procedure that involves evaluating and directing the plans for the use of ICT to support the organization and monitoring the achievement of these plans. The risks that may emerge during the implementation of IT governance must be properly assessed to ensure its success. In general, risk assessment in IT governance is focusing on the essential process to aid all relevant parties involved in IT implementation from both the technical and services aspects. Many studies related to IT risk assessment and risk assessments of IT governance have been reviewed based on a systematic method which is called Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Based on this approach, all previous studies related to this title can be analyzed systematically. Based on the same framework, this paper presents the results of the systematic reviews on the concept, process, framework, model and challenges of risk assessment of IT governance. In general, the findings from this review indicate that RA requires a more holistic consideration on numerous limitations and issues. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

In the study the authors have tried to decode the complex relationship among variables which is missing in extant literature.Design/methodology/approach - In the study the authors have used systematic literature review (SLR) approach to identify the variables from extant literature and used interpretive structural modelling (ISM) and Fuzzy MICMAC analysis to understand complex equation among variables from Indian manufacturing firm perspective.Findings - The findings using ISM modeling indicate top management support is the bottom level and business performance is the top level. In order to further resolve conflicts the authors have further analyzed variables using Fuzzy MICMAC analysis which has further divided variables into four clusters. The Fuzzy MICMAC output suggests that top management support, real time production information, training and team work are the driving variables and business performance, total quality management and lean behavior are the dependence variables.Research limitations/implications - Like any study, the study have its own limitations.

A key objective of the paper is to lay the foundation for a future research agenda by critically reviewing relevant literatures and offering insights into the use of case method in particular settings. The paper also helps identify areas where case method could add value to research findings in future scholarship. Design/methodology/approach – Using a Boolean search, a systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken across the “big five” entrepreneurship journals in the five-year period between 2008 and 2012 The search initially yielded a total of 269 “hits”. Following exclusion criteria, the list was refined to a total of 52 empirical papers, and these were reviewed using a comprehensive reading guide developed by the authors. Findings – The paper finds that relatively few articles published in the “big five” entrepreneurship journals use case method, despite repeated calls in the literature for more in-depth, qualitative approaches. This potentially suggests that case method is not fully accepted as a legitimate or sufficiently rigorous approach in the upper echelons of contemporary published entrepreneurship scholarship. Overall the paper argues for greater acceptance of the use of case method amongst the academic community, alongside greater confidence in its application. This can be achieved by learning from other disciplines where the case approach is more established. Research limitations/implications – While a comprehensive SLR was undertaken, the search was restricted to a limited time period and across a limited number of top tier journals. Practical implications – The paper highlights incidents where case method has been used successfully, identifies gaps in the literature and contributes towards setting a future research agenda that should be of particular value to qualitative researchers. Originality/value – The paper builds on extant literatures by furthering our understanding of the use of case method in entrepreneurship research. It should be of value to qualitative scholars applying case method in their empirical work, as well as those seeking to extend their methodological reach beyond a purely quantitative orientation. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Case method; Entrepreneurship; Qualitative research; Systematic literature review",,"Henry, C.; School of Business Humanities, Dundalk Institute of TechnologyIreland",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",13552554,,,,"English","Int.

The findings reveal that not only is SCRM loosely defined, but that there are various fragmented supply chain risks enablers and that there is a strong need for a clear terminology for its building enablers. In addition to that, the review points to a lack of empirical confirmation concerning the connection between SCRM and performance.

However, no systematic literature reviews (SLRs) focus on this topic. This SLR aims to gather evidence on the impact of the aforementioned system, also known as a patient data management system (PDMS) on both organizational and clinical outcomes. Materials and MethodsA literature search was performed using the databases Medline/PubMed and CINHAL for English articles published between January 2000 and December 2012. A quality assessment was performed on articles deemed relevant for the SLR. ResultsEighteen articles were included in the SLR. Sixteen articles investigated the impact of a PDMS on the organizational outcomes, comprising descriptive, quantitative and qualitative studies. A PDMS was found to reduce the charting time, increase the time spent on direct patient care and reduce the occurrence of errors. Only two articles investigated the clinical impact of a PDMS. Both reported an improvement in clinical outcomes when a PDMS was integrated with a clinical decision support system (CDSS). ConclusionsA PDMS has shown to offer many advantages in both the efficiency and the quality of care delivered to the patient. In addition, a PDMS integrated to a CDSS may improve clinical outcomes, although further studies are required for validation. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Bedside equipment; Clinical decision support systems (CDSS); Computer information system (CIS); Intensive care; Patient data management system (PDMS)","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Equipment; Hospital data processing; Information systems; Management information systems; Medical computing; Microchannels; Query languages; Reconnaissance aircraft; Search engines; Clinical decision support systems; Computer Information Systems; Intensive care; Organizational outcomes; Patient data management; Potential impacts; Quality assessment; Systematic literature review; Information management; anesthetic equipment; blood gas analyzer; clinical decision support system; computer information system; data base; descriptive research; dialysis equipment and supplies; human; infusion pump; intensive care; medical information system; meta analysis; outcomes research; patient care; patient data management system; patient monitor; patient monitoring; point of care testing; priority journal; qualitative research; quality control; quantitative analysis; Review; systematic review; ventilator; decision support system; health care organization; hospital; hospital information system; intensive care; medical error; organization and management; statistics and numerical data; workflow; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Efficiency, Organizational; Health Care Rationing; Health Information Exchange; Hospitals; Humans; Intensive Care; Medical Errors; Point-of-Care Systems; Workflow","Van Velden, F.H.P.; Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, VU University Medical Center, PO Box 7057, Netherlands",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd",13865056,,IJMIF,"25601332","English","Int.

Methods: First, a cross-sectional analytical study was performed. Non-erosive disease, defined as the absence of any erosion on X-rays after 5 years of RA, was evaluated in 500 patients. Further and additional evaluations including ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) were performed in those patients meeting the eligibility criteria. The Spearman correlation coefficient, kappa analysis, and Kendall[U+05F3]s W test were used to analyze the data. Second, a systematic literature review (SLR) was performed following the PRISMA guidelines. Results: Of a total of 40 patients meeting the eligibility criteria for non-erosive RA, eight patients were confirmed to have non-erosive RA by the three methods. A positive correlation between non-erosive RA and shorter disease duration, antinuclear antibodies positivity, lower rheumatoid factor (RF) and C-reactive protein titers, lower global visual analog scale values, toxic exposures, and lower disease activity-(RAPID3) was found. In addition, an inverse correlation with anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) positivity and medication use was observed. From the SLR, it was corroborated that factors associated with this subphenotype were shorter disease duration, younger disease onset, negative ACPA and RF titers, low cytokine levels, and some genetic markers. Conclusion: Non-erosive RA is rare, occurring in less than 2% of cases. These findings improve on the understanding of RA patients who present without erosions and are likely to have less severe disease. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Computed tomography; Erosions; Rheumatoid arthritis; Ultrasonography; X-ray","antinuclear antibody; C reactive protein; rheumatoid factor; autoantibody; adult; age distribution; Article; Asia; clinical evaluation; Colombia; computer assisted tomography; cross-sectional study; disease duration; echography; Europe; female; human; major clinical study; male; Mexico; non erosive rheumatoid arthritis; onset age; population research; prevalence; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; South and Central America; systematic review (topic); visual analog scale; X ray; bone; immunology; middle aged; radiography; rheumatoid arthritis; Adult; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Autoantibodies; Bone and Bones; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged","Anaya, J.-M.; Center for Autoimmune Diseases Research (CREA), School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad del Rosario, Carrera 24 No. 63C-69, Colombia",,"W.B.

Over the last few years, the role of replication in software engineering (SE), families of experiments and the need to aggregate the results of groups of experiments have attracted special attention. Frameworks, taxonomies, processes, recommendations and guidelines for reporting replications have been proposed to support the replication of SE experiments. There has been much less debate about the issue of the joint analysis of replications whose raw data are available to experimenters. Objectives: The aim of our research is to explore current trends in the joint analysis of SE experiments whose raw data are available to experimenters. Notice that the fact that experimenters have access to the raw data is what differentiates joint analysis from other methods for aggregating experimental results (e.g. systematic literature review (SLR), where the applicability of meta-analysis techniques is widely accepted). The objective of this three-year investigation is to shed light on the best joint analysis approach when the experimenters have access to raw data from several replications. Method: Narrative comparison, standard frequentist methods, meta-analysis and Bayesian methods have been used in SE literature. We will apply and evaluate each approach to the experiments on Test-Driven Development (TDD) carried out within the Experimental Software Engineering Industrial Laboratory (ESEIL) project. We will propose and rate a tentative framework for aggregating results within the ESEIL project. The proposed framework, as well as the different existing methods, will be evaluated on another set of replications of testing technique experiments. Current status: The thesis proposal was elicited on the 15 January 2015 and rounded out over the following six months. As a three-year thesis, its discussion and findings will be projected across the years 2015, 2016 and 2017. The first results are now being aggregated with the data from four different experiments on TDD (two in academia and two in industry), and preliminary results are expected to be available in October 2015. © 2015 for this paper by its authors.","Family of experiments; Joint analysis; Raw data; Se replication","Aggregates; Bayesian networks; Computer programming; Software engineering; Bayesian methods; Experimental software engineering; Frequentist methods; Joint analysis; Raw data; Systematic literature review (SLR); Test driven development; Testing technique; Software testing","Parrilla, A.S.; Department of Information Processing Science, University of OuluFinland; email: adrian.santos.parrilla@oulu.fi","Franch X.Baldassarre M.T.","CEUR-WS",16130073,,,,"English","CEUR Workshop Proc.",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954476854

The implementation of E-government differs from country to country and is associated with a number of challenges for public administrators. Cloud computing is widely proposed as a solution to enhance the development of E-government. Previously, we have conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify essential factors that influence the adoption of cloud computing for E-government implementation in developing countries. In this paper, we present a quantitative study involving 234 IT experts to confirm the significance of the identified factors. SPSS along with AMOS is employed to analyze the data. Confirmatory factor analysis, measurement model and structural model are executed. Findings indicate that the following factors significantly influence the adoption of cloud computing for E-government implementation in Iraq: complexity, compatibility, top management support, relative advantage, IT knowledge and security. The results show that trust and technology readiness have no significant influence on E-government implementation via cloud computing. On a wider perspective, non-technological factors require more attention than technological factors. This review will be useful to decision makers in governments and public sectors that intend to leverage cloud computing to overcome the challenges they face in implementing e-Government successfully. © 2015 IEEE.","cloud computing; critical factors; E-government; TOE","Cloud computing; Decision making; Developing countries; Distributed computer systems; Factor analysis; Information use; Confirmatory factor analysis; Critical factors; E-government implementation; E-governments; Information and Communication Technologies; Public service deliveries; Systematic literature review (SLR); Top management support; Government data processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395724,,,"English","IEEE Stud.

Currently, there are many notations in the area of business process modelling, where Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is denoted as the de facto standard. Aims: The aim of this research is to provide the state-of-the-art results addressing the acceptance of BPMN, while also examining the purposes of its usage. Furthermore, the advantages, disadvantages and other interests related to BPMN were also investigated. Method: To achieve these objectives, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and a semantic examination of articles’ citations was conducted. Results: After completing SLR, out of a total of 852 articles, 31 were deemed relevant. The majority of the articles analyzed the notation and compared it with other modelling techniques. The remainder evaluated general aspects of the notation, e.g. history and versions of the standard, usage of the notation or tools. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that there are empirical insights about the level of BPMN acceptance. They suggest that BPMN is still widely perceived as the de facto standard in the process modelling domain and its usage is ever-increasing. However, many studies report that only a limited set of elements are commonly used and to this end, several extensions were proposed. The main purpose of BPMN remains the description of business processes. © 2015 ComSIS Consortium.

The Brazilian National Policy of Solid Waste - NPSW, approved in 2010, obligates companies to implement reverse logistics. Considering this, many companies in Brazil have studied the possibility to outsource these activities by engaging third-party reverse logistics providers - 3PRLP. Considering these demands, it is important to define which systematic approaches can be used to select the most suitable 3PRLP. The objective of this article is to identify the main criteria, the systematic methods that can be used in order to select the most appropriate 3PRLP and also propose a framework based in multicriteria decision aid approach to select 3PRLP. Thus, a Systematic Literature Review was carried out and a conceptual framework for decision making in this context using Multicriteria Decision Aid - MCDA modeling was proposed. Therefore, this paper presents two contributions: i) a SLR covering the past decade based on the MCDA experiences in 3PRLP selection, highlighting the main criteria and systematic approaches used; ii) based on this SLR, a proposal for a conceptual methodological framework to help decision makers and researchers in performing a MCDA in the area of 3PRLP selection. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Historically, profitability and efficiency, and more recently customer satisfaction, quality and responsiveness objectives have been the prevailing interest for organisations. However, the move towards greener operations and products has forced companies to seek alternatives to combine these with green objectives and initiatives. Green lean is the result of this combination. Thus, the paper conceptually proposes Green Lean Six Sigma. Design/methodology/approach – To do this, a systematic literature review (SLR) of the subjects under investigation was conducted. Findings – The SLR indicated that the green lean integration may have inherited the same limitations as the individual green and lean approaches, but these may be overcome through the integration of Six Sigma. It also identified the similarities of some of the main attributes of green, lean and Six Sigma, which suggest their compatibility to be unified as an integrated approach. Practical implications – The paper allows scholars to develop a deeper and richer knowledge on the simultaneous deployment of green and operational improvement initiatives and help practitioners in formulating more effective strategies for their deployment.

Design/methodology/approach – In this paper the authors have adopted systematic literature review (SLR) to derive research objectives and questions. In order to answer research questions the authors have proposed a theoretical framework and derived research hypotheses. The authors identified constructs and items through extant literatures and developed a structured questionnaire which was pretested before using for final survey. The data were collected in two phases and also performed wave analysis to check non-response bias to avoid any significant impact of non-response bias on statistical analysis. The data has been used to conduct exploratory factor analysis using varimax rotation which reduces variables into five parsimonious and orthogonal factors. The factor analysis output was further used as an input of regression analysis. Findings – The factor analysis output has further validated the findings from literature review. The factor analysis output suggests that total quality management (TQM), supplier relationship management (SRM), R&D and technology and lean manufacturing practices are important determinants of Indian firms practicing green manufacturing practices which impact extended supply chain performance. The regression analysis output has further established that TQM and R&D and technology are strong determinants of extended supply chain performance. However, present study does not support SRM and lean manufacturing practices from respondent’s perspective. However, it further needs to be explored. Research limitations/implications – The present study is limited to medium-sized manufacturing firms. Second, the conclusive model explains only 31.9 percent of the total extended supply chain performance. The study provides an insight to managers that those companies which have implemented TQM and green technology have realized superior performance in comparison to those which have not successfully implemented. Originality/value – The present study is toward understanding Indian green manufacturing practices. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Manufacturing; Performance management; Supply chain management",,"Dubey, R.; Department of Operations Management, Symbiosis International UniversityIndia",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",14635771,,BQMTF,,"English","Benchmarking",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931394895

If such patterns do exist, there could be important implications for the timing of interventions for both prevention and care. This review provides a summary of the available literature on weekly patterns in HIV-relevant behaviors and existing interventions (including prevention and antiretroviral therapy [ART] adherence), and provides recommendations for additional research. Data were collected from published reports indexed from database inception through December 2014 and identified through PubMed and EBSCO. Only English language reports were included. Evidence of weekly patterns was found in information-seeking behaviors, risk behaviors, screening and care, and structuring of existing interventions, including ART adherence interventions. These patterns included increased interest in HIV-related information early in the week, weekend patterns of risk behavior among some populations, and interest in weekend and evening clinic hours. Literature on text messaging for ART adherence indicates that weekly short message service messages are the most effective. Implications for prevention and adherence interventions are discussed, and recommendations for future research are given. © 2015 © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","adherence; behavior; messaging; patterns; SMS; weekly","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; antiviral therapy; Article; attitude to AIDS; follow up; health behavior; high risk behavior; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; information seeking; medical information; medication compliance; men who have sex with men; meta analysis; patient care; patient compliance; periodicity; post exposure prophylaxis; pre-exposure prophylaxis; priority journal; prostitution; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk reduction; screening; sexual behavior; smoking cessation; substance abuse; systematic review; text messaging; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; male; male homosexuality; methodology; primary prevention; procedures; psychology; risk reduction; sexual behavior; text messaging; trends; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; Primary Prevention; Research Design; Risk Reduction Behavior; Sexual Behavior; Text Messaging","Fuentes, L.W.; Department of Health, Behavior and Society, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public HealthUnited States",,"Routledge",09540121,,AIDCE,"25894315","English","AIDS Care Psychol.

Whilst a lot of hype has been seen since its introduction in 2001 with the Agile manifesto where delivery success was promised, software practitioners still appear to be weary as unfavourable usage perceptions dominate the software industry and the transition appears to be a formidable task. Project success and failure scenarios have been researched but the factors that establish these are still widely inconclusive and elusive creating more interest and emphasis for embarking on further research. This paper highlights and investigates the relationship between agile software development methodologies and the success and failure scenarios prevalent in the software industry. Objective: To provide new success and failure causes and roots to a new adaptive and dynamic hybrid agile methodology that could further enhance software delivery success with more frequent use of agile methodologies in a reliable manner. Method: The methodology used is the Evidence-Based Software Engineering (EBSE) research and practice. Additionally, the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method was also incorporated as it provided a rigorous review and synthesis of research results. In analysing the reviewed data, we have used the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method as it provided a clear approach in attaching priorities to recommended solutions. Results: Through a review of a set of research articles on project management history, its disciplines, its relative misunderstood and with the inconsistencies in the adoption and use of agile methodologies, it has been shown that barriers still exist and the strategies of removing these obstacles and transforming them into catalysts, while been investigated and developed, still appears to be a challenge. Agile methodologies work when a broader spectrum of perceptive adaptations and a new set of dynamic critical success factors, especially when a new methodology which incorporates these catalysts for a set of project activities is developed. Contribution: The study has contributed in proposing a new set of success and failure causes and the roots to a new agile methodology from the analysis and findings. These would be useful for researchers and software practitioners who are interested to do studies on the further adoption and use of existing agile methodologies or to tailor agile methodologies as hybrids versions in the future. Conclusion: Success and failure scenarios are the mainstream derivative constructs of project delivery studies in terms of the moving forward in achieving higher project success rate. Issues with stakeholders were the major areas of concern as success and failure contributors. Other important factors were organisational culture and methodology, which needed equal attention as gaps still prevailed and at times festered to its own disadvantage. The most interesting find was that these contributors were equally important whether we used traditionally formal methods or moved to agilitic methods. This also explains the flat success rate for software projects over the last 5 years as we probably reached a point where we have been addressing areas in terms of causes and were not specifically trying to weed out the areas independent and applicable to the software industry. We recommend that a dynamic approach both to the causes and the methodology is the answer as the software industry does not sit still in todays’ ever changing user demands and expectations. Environments with a dynamic methodology, which encompasses a dynamic set of critical success causes as its inception based on a set of dynamic success indicators, is the key answer. The dynamic success (and failure) factors, indicators and the derived methodology are recommended from our study. This we feel should be the approach for all new and future research. © 2005 - 2015 JATIT & LLS.

Beside disease modifying antirheumatic drugs and glucocorticoids for the treatment of inflammatory activity, pain medication is an important treatment module in the management of arthritis. It was the goal of this 3e (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) initiative to develop evidence-based recommendations for pain management by pharmacotherapy. Materials and Methods: A total of 453 rheumatologists from 17 countries participated in the international 3e Initiative. The group of German experts comprised 66 participants. Using a Delphi process with 3 rounds of discussion, 10 international and 2 national clinical questions were selected regarding the use of pain medications in inflammatory joint disease. A systematic literature research (SLR) was performed in May 2010 for each question using Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and the 2008/2009 EULAR/ACR abstracts. The national experts used the retrieved evidence to develop a set of national recommendations and assessed them for agreement and potential impact on clinical practice. Subsequently, the consensus recommendations were drafted. Results: A total of 49 242 references were identified, from which 167 studies were included in the systematic review. Based on this evidence, 12 recommendations and an algorithm for pharmacological management of pain were developed in response to the multinational questions. The recommendations related to the efficacy and safety of various analgesics, their use in different comorbidities and during pregnancy and lactation, the utility of pain measurement scales, as well as pain management. With regard to the 2 additional national questions, 34 out of 7 334 retrieved publications could be used to develop two recommendations on treatment monitoring and herbal medicine. Conclusion: 14 evidence-based recommendations and an algorithm on the management of pain by pharmacotherapy in inflammatory joint disease were developed. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart, New York.","analgesics; arthritis; herbal medicine; inflammatory joint disease; recommendations","analgesic agent; analgesia; arthralgia; arthritis; Article; clinical practice; comorbidity; consensus; drug effect; drug safety; evidence based practice; German (citizen); herbal medicine; human; lactation; medical expert; pain measurement; patient monitoring; pregnancy; systematic review","Tarner, I.H.; Lehrstuhl für Innere Medizin Mit Schwerpunkt Rheumatologie Justus, Liebig-Universität Gieen, Kerckhoff-Klinik, Benekestrae 2-8, Germany",,"Georg Thieme Verlag",0341051X,,AKRHD,,"German","Aktuel.

Leadership is the most discussed and one of the most debated dimensions and little is known about leadership integration with a humanitarian supply chain network design. We carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify variables and their items to design a structured questionnaire, which was pretested with experts in the humanitarian supply chain. We conducted an empirical study on a sample of 306 responses that were collected by us during Allahabad Kumbh from senior officials of the police department, Indian Railways, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation and third-party logistics (3PL) companies. We have used the exploratory factor analysis followed by the confirmatory factor analysis to check the construct validity of scales and goodness of fit. We further tested our hypotheses using regression analysis and mediation effect using Baron and Kenny’s (1986) proposed steps. We further checked the mediation significance using the Sobel test. We found that supply chain alignment is a strong determinant of logistics performance and human performance. The supply chain agility is found to completely mediate between supply chain adaptability and human performance and partially mediate between supply chain adaptability and logistics performance.

Efforts have been made to assess whether human consumption of chia can reduce cardiovascular risk factors; however, it has not been established as effective and the findings of the few studies to have looked into the matter are inconsistent. Aim: to systematize the findings of studies assessing the effect the consumption of chia seed, either milled or whole, has in the prevention/control of cardiovascular risk factors in humans. Methods: this is a systematic literature review (SLR) with no meta-analysis. The articles scrutinizedwere identified in the electronic databases Lilacs, Medline (Pub-Med version), Cochrane, Scielo, Scopus, and Web of Science under the keywords”dyslipidemia” or “dislipidemia”, “hyperlipidemia” or “hiperlipidemia”, “obesity” or “obesidade”, “salvia”or”salviahispanica”, “Lamiaceae” or “chia”, “hypertension” or “hipertensão”, “hypertrygliceridemia” or “hipertrigliceridemia”, and “riscocardiovascular” or “cardiovascularrisk.” We chose for our selection English-, Portuguese-or Spanish-language articles about clinical trials on humans and published within the last ten years. The biases of risk analysis were carried out considering 6 of the 8 criteria of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions Version 5.1. Findings: seven studies (n = 200) fit our inclusion criteria. Of the chosen clinical trials, only one was not randomized. Five of the studies were blind experiments. Two of the studies were acute trials, both of them randomized. Of the chia seed interventions, one study showed a significant drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and inflammatory markers, yet there was no change in body mass, lipid profile or blood sugar. In four of the studies reviewed there was a significant spike in ALA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), with no significant change to other parameters. In the acute trials, post-prandial blood hipertriglisugar was significantly lower. Only one study showed a significant drop in triglycerides (TG), body mass and inflammatory markers; however, the chia seed in that case was mixed with other foods. Most of the studies showed unclear or low risk of bias. Two studies showed a high risk of bias because not all the pre-specified primary outcomes were reported in the findings. Conclusion: most of the studies did not demonstrate statistically significant results in relation to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The evidence regarding the relationship between chia seed consumption and cardiovascular risk factors are insufficient, and the studies included in this review present numerous limitations. Further research is hence needed. © 2015, Grupo Aula Medica S.A.

As mobile phone use spreads rapidly, a new model of remote health delivery via mobile phone - mHealth - is increasingly used. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of how mHealth can be used to improve adherence to medication. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted using four databases (CINAHLubMed, Scopus and PsycARTICLES). Eligible articles available on March 2014 had to be written in English or Spanish and have a comparative design. Articles were reviewed by two authors independently. A Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the studies based on their internal validity. Results Of the 1504 articles found, 20 fulfilled the inclusion criteria [13 randomised clinical trials (RCT), one quasi-RCT, one non-randomised parallel group study and five studies with a pre-post design]. Nearly all the trials were conducted in high-income countries (80.0%). Articles were categorised depending on the target population into three different groups: (i) HIV-infected patients, n = 5; (ii) patients with other chronic diseases (asthma, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, infectious diseases, transplant recipients and psoriasis), n = 11; and (iii) healthy individuals, n = 4. Adherence improved in four of the studies on HIV-infected patients, in eight of the studies on patients with other chronic diseases, and in 1 study performed in healthy individuals. All studies reported sending SMS as medication reminders, healthy lifestyle reminders, or both. Only one trial (HIV-infected patients) had a low risk of bias. Conclusions Our results showed mixed evidence regarding the benefits of interventions because of the variety of the study designs and the results found. Nevertheless, the interventions do seem to have been beneficial, as 65% of the studies had positive outcomes.

However, the studies pertaining to EUS for staging early gastric cancer have reported widely varied sensitivities and specificities. This study was conducted to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of EUS for staging the depth in EGCs. Methods: The literatures were identified by searching in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Knowledge databases. Two reviewers independently extracted the information from the literatures for constructing 2×2 table. A random-effect model or a fixed-effect model was used to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio. A summary receiver operating characteristic curve also was constructed. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were used to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Results: The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of EUS for M staging were 76% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74-78%), 72% (95% CI, 69-75%), 3.67 (95% CI, 2.48-5.44), and 0.31 (95% CI, 0.24-0.40), respectively. For SM staging, these results were 62% (95% CI, 59-66%), 78% (95% CI, 76-80%), 2.99 (95% CI, 2.26-3.96), and 0.43 (95% CI, 0.32-0.57), respectively. For M/SM1 staging, they were 90% (95% CI, 88-92%), 67% (95% CI, 61-72%), 3.14 (95% CI, 2.08-4.73), and 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07-0.22), respectively. The area under the curve for mucosal, submucosal, and mucosal/minimal submucosal invasion staging were 0.85, 0.82, and 0.81, respectively. Conclusions: Endoscopic ultrasonography only has a relatively low accuracy for staging the depth of invasion in EGCs. Accordingly, EUS may be not indispensable in the staging of EGCs. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Cancer staging; Early gastric cancer; Endoscopic ultrasonography","Article; cancer staging; clinical feature; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; early cancer; endoscopic echography; human; major clinical study; meta analysis; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; stomach cancer; stomach wall; systematic review; tumor invasion; bibliographic database; cancer staging; echography; endoscopic ultrasonography; pathology; stomach tumor; tumor invasion; Databases, Bibliographic; Endosonography; Humans; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Stomach Neoplasms","Lv, Y.; Department of Gastroenterology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University, Medical SchoolChina",,"Blackwell Publishing",08159319,,JGHEE,"26094975","English","J.

Based on systematic literature reviews (SLRs) of clinical trials and registries, International Recommendations published in 2015 represent expert opinion describing efficacy and safety of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs). A total of 10 recommendations are detailed from four ""Overarching Principles"": (1) treatment decisions are shared between patient and rheumatologist; (2) the primary goalv is to maximize long-term quality of life by controlling the symptoms, preventing joint damage, and by normalizing the function and social and work participation; (3) abrogation (not just control) of inflammation is the most effective method to achieve this goal; (4) T2T by measuring disease activity regularly and adjusting therapy to achieve remission/LDA optimizes outcomes in RA. The SLRs provide solid evidence that methotrexate is the ""anchor"" of csDMARD and that step-up therapy by adding/substituting other csDMARDs, such as sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), or/and leflunomide (LEF) is as effective as combination therapy to initiate. Tofacitinib, a recently marketed csDMARD, may be more effective in comparison to MTX, and can be used in combination. Rapid disease control can be achieved by ""bridging"" with various regimens of glucocorticoids (GCs), but tapering to doses ≤7.5 mg/day is critical to limit side effects. In practice settings, use of bDMARDs is influenced by reimbursement. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are highly used, but as more data emerge, there appear to be no major differences to more recently available targeted bDMARD monoclonal antibodies such as abatacept (co-stimulation blockade), rituximab (B cell depleting), tocilizumab (TCZ) (interleukin (IL)-6 receptor blockade). Rituximab appears to be most effective for seropositive patients, and tocilizumab may be more effective as a monotherapy in patients intolerant to csDMARDs. Besides T2T, attention to managing treatment and optimizing outcomes should take into account potential adverse effects, such as risk of serious infection, as well as potential morbidity/mortality related to cardiovascular events, pulmonary disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, and fibromyalgia which often influence some measures, such as the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A web site is the main source that provides users' needs. However, some of the existing web sites are not well intentioned by users. Many studies have treated the problem of assessing the web sites' quality of different categories such as ecommerce, education, entertainment, health, etc. The problematic implies a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) due to the multiple conflicting criteria for assessment. Existing methods are mainly based on making a hierarchy to divide high level criteria, sub-level criteria and alternatives. There is no standard until now that defines important criteria for evaluation. Indeed, this paper presents a process of collecting and extracting data from a list of studies according to a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. In fact, it is necessary to know frequent criteria used in the literature for establishing the task of assessment. This paper proposes also a determination of an association rules' set extracted from a set of criteria by applying an Apriori method. © 2014 IEEE.","Assessing Web Sites; Association rules; Multiple Criteria; Systematic Literature Review","Association rules; Decision making; Intelligent systems; Social networking (online); Apriori; Criteria for evaluations; Multiple criteria; Multiple criteria decision making; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Websites","Rekik, R.; REGIM-Lab, Research Groups in Intelligent Machines, University of Sfax, BP 1173, Tunisia; email: rim.rekik@ieee.org",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479976331,,,"English","Int.

BPD is associated with poor long-term respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome and increased mortality. The prophylactic use of agents that modulate inflammation such as pentoxifylline, a synthetic methylxanthine and phosphodiesterase inhibitor, may reduce the incidence of BPD. Objectives: The primary objective of this review was to determine the effect of pentoxifylline on the incidence of BPD, death prior to 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), and BPD or death prior to 36 weeks PMA in preterm neonates. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library Issue 9, 2012), EMBASE (January 1974 to September 2012), PubMed (January 1966 to September 2012), and CINAHL (January 1982 to September 2012) in September 2012. We checked references and cross-references from identified studies. We handsearched abstracts from the proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies Meetings (from January 1990 to September 2012). We placed no restrictions on language. Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised clinical trials of systemic or nebulised pentoxifylline in preterm neonates less than 32 weeks gestational age or less than 1500 g birth weight, reporting on at least one outcome of interest, were eligible for inclusion in the review. Data collection and analysis: We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group and The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors (SMS and SK) independently searched the literature as described above and selected studies. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion involving all review authors. Main results: We identified one randomised clinical trial eligible for inclusion in this review. This study compared the use of nebulised pentoxifylline versus placebo for prevention of BPD in 100 preterm infants and was at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding of intervention and outcome assessors, and incomplete outcome data. There was no statistically significant effect of nebulised pentoxifylline versus placebo on individual outcomes of BPD at 36 weeks PMA or on death prior to 36 weeks PMA. There was no significant effect of nebulised pentoxifylline on intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, sepsis, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) requiring ligation. The study did not report any of the other secondary outcomes considered for this review. Reporting of adverse events was very limited and did not allow for reliable judgement on the incidence of such events. No long-term outcomes were reported. Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to determine the safety and efficacy of pentoxifylline for prevention of BPD in preterm neonates. We encourage researchers to conduct clinical trials to confirm or refute the role of pentoxifylline for prevention of BPD in preterm neonates. These trials should report on clinically important outcomes and, ideally, on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. © 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"pentoxifylline; placebo; pentoxifylline; phosphodiesterase inhibitor; adulthood; birth weight; brain hemorrhage; breathing disorder; child death; childhood; clinical outcome; comparative study; drug effect; gestation period; human; incidence; infant; leukomalacia; lung dysplasia; nebulization; patent ductus arteriosus; periventricular leukomalacia; prematurity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; sepsis; side effect; systematic review; treatment duration; Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia; gestational age; Infant, Premature, Diseases; mortality; newborn; prematurity; Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infant, Premature, Diseases; Pentoxifylline; Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Schulzke, S.M.; University of Basel Children's Hospital (UKBB), Department of Neonatology, Spitalstrasse 21, Switzerland; email: sven.schulzke@unibas.ch",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",1469493X,,,"25418278","English","Cochrane Database Syst.

Systematic knowledge is still lacking on how the mobile telephone text messaging (short message service, SMS) has been used in health care services. Objective: This study aims to review the literature on the use of mobile phone text message reminders in health care. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of studies on mobile telephone text message reminders. The data sources used were PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL, Proquest Databases/ PsycINFO, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and hand searching since 2003. Studies reporting the use of SMS intended to remind patients in health services were included. Given the heterogeneity in the studies, descriptive characteristics, purpose of the study, response rates, description of the intervention, dose and timing, instruments, outcome measures, and outcome data from the studies were synthesized using a narrative approach. Results: From 911 initial citations, 60 studies were included in the review. The studies reported a variety of use for SMS. Mobile telephone text message reminders were used as the only intervention in 73% (44/60) of the studies, and in 27% (16/60) of the remaining studies, SMS was connected to another comprehensive health intervention system. SMS reminders were sent to different patient groups: patients with HIV/AIDS (15%, 9/60) and diabetes (13%, 8/60) being the most common groups. The response rates of the studies varied from 22-100%. Typically, the text message reminders were sent daily. The time before the specific intervention to be rendered varied from 10 minutes (eg, medication taken) to 2 weeks (eg, scheduled appointment). A wide range of different evaluation methods and outcomes were used to assess the impact of SMS varying from existing databases (eg, attendance rate based on medical records), questionnaires, and physiological measures. About three quarters of the studies (77%, 46/60) reported improved outcomes: adherence to medication or to treatment reportedly improved in 40% (24/60) of the studies, appointment attendance in 18% (11/60) of the studies, and non-attendance rates decreased in 18% (11/60) of the studies. Other positive impacts were decreased amount of missed medication doses, more positive attitudes towards medication, and reductions in treatment interruptions. Conclusions: We can conclude that although SMS reminders are used with different patient groups in health care, SMS is less systematically studied with randomized controlled trial study design. Although the amount of evidence for SMS application recommendations is still limited, having 77% (46/60) of the studies showing improved outcomes may indicate its use in health care settings. However, more well-conducted SMS studies are still needed. ©Kati Anneli Kannisto, Marita Hannele Koivunen, Maritta Anneli Välimäki.","Cellular phone; Reminder system; Review; Short message service; Text messaging","Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; diabetes mellitus; health service; hospital management; human; methodology; mobile phone; questionnaire; reminder system; text messaging; Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Appointments and Schedules; Cell Phones; Diabetes Mellitus; Health Services; Humans; Questionnaires; Reminder Systems; Research Design; Text Messaging","Kannisto, K.A.; Department of Nursing Science, University of Turku, Lemminkäisenkatu 1, Finland",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,"25326646","English","J.

WCM has attracted serious research attention in the recent past, especially after the financial crisis of 2008. Design/methodology/approach – Using systematic literature review (SLR) method, the present study reviews 126 articles from referred journal and international conferences published on WCM. Findings – Detailed content analysis reveals that most of the research work is empirical and focuses mainly on two aspects, impact of working capital on profitability of firm and working capital practices. Major research work has concluded that WCM is essential for corporate profitability. The major issues with prior literature are lack of survey-based approach and lack of systematic theory development study, which opens all new areas for future research. The future research directions proposed in this paper may help develop a greater understanding of determinants and practices of WCM. Practical implications – Till date, literature on classification of WCM has been almost non-existent. This paper reviews a large number of articles on WCM and provides a classification scheme in to various categories. Subsequently, various emerging trends in the field of WCM are identified to help researchers specifying gaps in the literature and direct research efforts. Originality/value – This paper contains a comprehensive listing of publications on the WCM and their classification according to various attributes. The paper will be useful to researchers, finance professionals and others concerned with WCM to understand the importance of WCM.

However, the results were vulnerable to the removal of one key randomized controlled trial (RCT) because of insufficient data. Furthermore, recently published RCTs highlighted the need for an update of the SLR to challenge the robustness of results. Methods: The protocol for the new SLR included more stringent tests of robustness than used initially and the meta-analysis was updated with the results of two new RCTs as well as the count of patients and SSIs by U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) incision class. Results: The updated SLR included 15 RCTs with 4,800 patients. No publication bias was suggested in the analysis. The predominant effect estimated a relative risk of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.54-0.84, p=0.00053) with an overall lower frequency of SSI in the TS arm than in the NTS arm. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: The two additional peer-reviewed double-blind RCTs of this update confirmed the predominant effect found in the authors' previous meta-analysis and established the robustness of conclusions that were lacking previously. This SLR and meta-analysis showed that the use of triclosan antimicrobial sutures reduced the incidence of SSI after clean, clean-contaminated, and contaminated surgery.

As our society relies more and more on the web, the dependability of web applications has become increasingly important. To make these applications more dependable, for the past decade researchers have proposed various techniques for testing web-based software applications. Our literature search for related studies retrieved 193 papers in the area of web application testing, which have appeared between 2000 and 2013. Objective As this research area matures and the number of related papers increases, it is important to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the publications and provide an overview of the trends and empirical evidence in this specialized field. Methods We systematically review the body of knowledge related to functional testing of web application through a systematic literature review (SLR) study. This SLR is a follow-up and complimentary study to a recent systematic mapping (SM) study that we conducted in this area. As part of this study, we pose three sets of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and synthesize the empirical evidence in this area. Results Our pool of studies includes a set of 95 papers (from the 193 retrieved papers) published in the area of web application testing between 2000 and 2013. The data extracted during our SLR study is available through a publicly-accessible online repository. Among our results are the followings: (1) the list of test tools in this area and their capabilities, (2) the types of test models and fault models proposed in this domain, (3) the way the empirical studies in this area have been designed and reported, and (4) the state of empirical evidence and industrial relevance. Conclusion We discuss the emerging trends in web application testing, and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results of our SLR can help researchers to obtain an overview of existing web application testing approaches, fault models, tools, metrics and empirical evidence, and subsequently identify areas in the field that require more attention from the research community. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Systematic literature review; Testing; Web application","Online repositories; Research communities; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic mapping; WEB application; Web application testing; Web-based softwares; Application programs; Paper; Research; Software testing; Testing; World Wide Web; Applications","Garousi, V.; Software Quality Engineering Research Group (SoftQual), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; email: vgarousi@ucalgary.ca",,,01641212,,JSSOD,,"English","J Syst Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900597825

Today, network survivability analysis is an essential aspect of reliable communication especially in MANETs. Although various methods have been proposed to model network survivability analysis in MANETs, no related review has been published as to date for this topic. Thus, a comprehensive review of this body of work would be beneficial to researchers to have an overview of the current state of research trend in this area. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of the state of the art approach in modeling network survivability analysis in MANETs. We used studies from a number of relevant article sources, and our results showed the existence of twenty six articles. From this SLR we found that the existing of modeling method is focusing on individual node in which the node is treated as independent event. Furthermore, the analysis also reveals the less popular methods in modeling network survivability analysis are with statistical methods such as regression analysis and survival analysis. The implication of this study is to give a clear direction to future researchers in this area for a better and accurate analysis in measuring network survivability in MANETs. © 2014 IEEE.","MANETs; Network survivability; Systematic Literature Review","Mobile security; Regression analysis; Wireless telecommunication systems; MANETs; Network survivability; Reliable communication; State of research; State-of-the-art approach; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Wireless technologies; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479981151,,,"English","Congr.

SNs has been used by millions of people around the world for sharing thoughts and daily life events on many topics, either it is political, crisis, Peace building (Pb). The objective of this paper is to get insight of Pb Event Mining (EM) from SNs (e.g., Tweets, Fb posts, etc) by conducting the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process. The paper aims to answer some research questions (RQs) that includes, 1) Which SN's has been widely used for Textual Pb Event Mining PbEM?, 2) What Context or setting has been focussed of PbEM studies and how to categorize Pb events?, and 3) What other types of events (non-Pb) are reported? The SLR process has been used to identify the related literature and for analysis of evidences in order to answer the RQs. This paper concluded on the basis of SLR studies that the 'Twitter' is widely used SN for Textual PbEM because 54 out of 64 studies on PbEM uses Twitter. SLR resulted that earth quake (EQ) events are the major concerned events that effect country's economy and peace therefore most of studies uses the EQ as context/setting.

Methods Systematic literature review (SLR) of observational studies (including registries). Interventions were any bDMARD (anakinra, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, rituximab, abatacept, tocilizumab, golimumab or certolizumab pegol) or sDMARD (methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, gold/auranofin, azathioprine, chlorambucil, chloroquine, cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, minocycline, penicillamine, tacrolimus or tofacitinib) and a comparator was required. Information on GCs was collected from the included studies. All safety outcomes were included. Results Forty-nine observational studies addressing diverse safety outcomes of therapy with bDMARDs met eligibility criteria. Substantial heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis of any of the outcomes. Patients on tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) compared to patients on conventional sDMARDs had a higher risk of serious infections (adjusted HR (aHR) 1.1-1.8), a higher risk of tuberculosis, and an increased risk of infection by herpes zoster cannot be excluded. Patients on TNFi did not have an increased risk for malignancies in general, lymphoma or non-melanoma skin cancer, but the risk of melanoma may be slightly increased (aHR 1.5). From the studies identified on conventional sDMARDs, no new safety signals were found. Conclusions The findings from this SLR confirm the known safety pattern of sDMARDs and bDMARDs for the treatment of RA.",,"anti-TNF; DMARDs (biologic); DMARDs (synthetic); outcomes research; Rheumatoid arthritis; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biological Products; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Neoplasms; Opportunistic Infections; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Assessment; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Ramiro, S.; Department of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 9, Amsterdam 1105 AZ, Netherlands; email: sofiaramiro@gmail.com",,,00034967,,ARDIA,"24401994","English","Ann.

However, it is unclear how effective self-directed interventions are and how they promote weight loss and weight maintenance. Objective: A systematic review of reviews was conducted to examine the effectiveness of such interventions and to identify intervention content associated with effectiveness. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library for systematic reviews were searched from 2000-2012 for reviews of the effectiveness of self-directed interventions on weight loss and weight maintenance in adults. Two reviewers used predefined inclusion criteria to select relevant reviews and assess their quality using the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ). We extracted data on effectiveness and on relationships between intervention characteristics and effectiveness. Results: Twenty reviews were included and quality assessed. Findings relevant to self-directed interventions, including interactive websites, smartphone applications, and text messaging (short message service, SMS) were summarized. Findings were mixed but promising. For example, one review of Internet-based interventions found that, when used in conjunction with standard weight loss programs, these interventions resulted in a significant average increase in weight loss of 1.5 kg over evaluation periods. Unfortunately, only 7 of 20 reviews were of high methodological quality according to OQAQ scores, and only 4 employed meta-analyses. Few reviews linked intervention content to effectiveness. Conclusions: Current evidence suggests that self-directed interventions can independently promote weight loss and can augment interventions involving personal contact. Particular change techniques and delivery modes including individualized feedback, email counseling, and online social support appear to enhance effectiveness. Further reviews of the content of self-directed weight-loss intervention studies are needed to clarify which change techniques delivered through which delivery formats optimize intervention effectiveness.","EHealth; Home-based; Internet; Intervention; Obesity; Self-delivered; Systematic review; Text message; Weight loss","adult; e-mail; home-based; human; Internet; Intervention; literature; middle aged; mobile phone; obesity; review; self care; self-delivered; systematic review; telehealth; text message; weight reduction; eHealth; home-based; Internet; intervention; obesity; self-delivered; systematic review; text message; weight loss; Adult; Cellular Phone; Electronic Mail; Humans; Internet; Middle Aged; Review Literature as Topic; Self Care; Weight Loss","Abraham, C.; University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter, St Luke's Campus, Heavitree Road, Exeter, EX1 2LU, United Kingdom; email: C.Abraham@exeter.ac.uk",,,14388871,,,"24554464","English","J.

Currently, SLR authors must perform the dificult, time-consuming task in largely manual fashion. To identify barriers faced by SLR authors, we conducted an interactive community workshop prior to ESEM'13. Workshop participants generated a total of 100 ideas that, through group discussions, formed 37 composite barriers to the SLR process. Further analysis reveals the barriers relate to latent themes regarding the SLR process, primary studies, the practitioner community, and tooling. This paper describes the barriers identified during the workshop along with a ranking of those barriers that is based on votes by workshop attendees. The paper concludes by describing the impact of these barriers on three important constituencies: SLR Methodology Researchers, SLR Authors and SLR consumers.

In the research context, an ordinary and formal method frequently followed to analyse the situation is the Systematic Literature Review (SLR). However, SLR is not enough, if the study is oriented towards comparing technologies or tools solutions. This paper presents a mechanism to be applied systematically in surveys and comparative studies of tools and technological solutions. It is based on general concepts defined in SLR, but it extends them in order to cover other necessities. The paper illustrates how this mechanism is applied to a real project named THOT and it offers conclusions and learned lessons from the last trends.","Comparative studies; Enterprise content management; Surveys; Systematic literature reviews","Formal methods; Surveying; Comparative studies; Enterprise content managements; Enterprise environment; Research environment; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technical tools; Technological solution; Surveys",,"Linger H.Vrcek N.Lang M.Barry C.Schneider C.Vukovac D.P.Strahonja V.","University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics Varazdin",,9789536071432,,,"English","Inf.

SLRs and meta-analysis techniques are increasingly being used in other fields as well, from Social Sciences to Software Engineering. This paper presents the SLRTool tool - an open source, webbased, multi-user tool that supports the SLR process for a range of research areas. The tool is available at http://www.slrtool.org and is developed using a model-driven approach to enable its adaptation to different disciplines. The functionality of the tool is presented in the context of support for various phases of the SLR process. The use of the tool is illustrated by means of a simulated SLR aiming to map out existing research in the domain of Enterprise Architecture (EA). Commentary on the use of the tool and potential additional benefits are discussed, for example, the role of the tool in non-medical meta-studies.The SLRTool tool supports all phases of the SLR process and lends itself to creating and supporting research communities geared to SLR oriented activities. In particular, the tool could be suitable for the novice researcher community.

The objectives are: to present a systematic literature review (SLR) in the field of EMP; to identify, classify and improve the existing, or implement new, methods which try to overcome EMP and evaluate them. Method. We performed SLR based on the search of digital libraries. We implemented four second order mutation (SOM) strategies, in addition to first order mutation (FOM), and compared them from different perspectives. Results. Our SLR identified 17 relevant techniques (in 22 articles) and three categories of techniques: detecting (DEM); suggesting (SEM); and avoiding equivalent mutant generation (AEMG). The experiment indicated that SOM in general and JudyDiffOp strategy in particular provide the best results in the following areas: total number of mutants generated; the association between the type of mutation strategy and whether the generated mutants were equivalent or not; the number of not killed mutants; mutation testing time; time needed for manual classification. Conclusions. The results in the DEM category are still far from perfect. Thus, the SEM and AEMG categories have been developed. The JudyDiffOp algorithm achieved good results in many areas. © 2014 IEEE.","equivalent mutant problem; higher order mutation; Mutation testing; second order mutation","Digital libraries; Experiments; Comparative experiments; Equivalent Mutants; higher order mutation; Manual classification; Mutation testing; Second orders; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software testing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",00985589,,IESED,,"English","IEEE Trans Software Eng",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898474065

The idea behind SPL management is to focus on artifacts that are shared in order to support software reuse and adaptation. Gains are expected in terms of time to market, consistency across products, costs reduction, better flexibility, and better management of change requirements. In this context, there are many available options of SPL variability management tools. This paper presents and discusses the findings from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of SPL management tools. Our research method aimed at analyzing the available literature on SPL management tools and the involved experts in the field. This review provides insights (i) to support companies interested to choose a tool for SPL variability management that best fits their needs; (ii) to point out attributes and requirements relevant to those interested in developing new tools; and (iii) to help the improvement of the tools already available.

[Method] We applied the same methodology used in the SLR we are extending herein (covering the period 2006-2013) based on primary studies that compared predictions from cross-company models with predictions from within-company models constructed from analysis of project data. [Results] We identified 11 additional papers; however two of these did not present independent results and one had inconclusive findings. Two of the remaining eight papers presented both, trials where cross-company predictions were not significantly different from within-company predictions and others where they were significantly different. Four found that cross-company models gave prediction accuracy significantly different from within-company models (one of them in favor of cross-company models), while two found no significant difference. The main pattern when examining the study related factors was that studies where cross-company predictions were significantly different from within-company predictions employed larger within-company data sets. [Conclusions] Overall, half of the analyzed evidence indicated that cross-company estimation models are not significantly worse than within-company estimation models. Moreover, there is some evidence that sample size does not imply in higher estimation accuracy, and that samples for building estimation models should be carefully selected/filtered based on quality control and project similarity aspects. The results need to be combined with the findings from the SLR we are extending to allow further investigating this topic.

We evaluated SKE by building a software inspection EMSE BoK KB from knowledge acquired by controlled experiments. We elicited relevant queries from EMSE researchers and systematically integrated information from 30 representative research papers into the KB. [Results] The resulting KB was effective in answering the queries, enabling knowledge reuse for analyses beyond the results from the SLR process. [Conclusion] SKE showed promising results in the software inspection context and should be evaluated in other contexts for building EMSE BoKs faster.

In order to guarantee the correct interoperability of such systems, with respect to functional and non-functional requirements, integration testing is an effective measure to achieve this. Model-based testing moreover not only enables early definition and validation, but also test automation. This makes it a good choice to overcome urgent challenges of integration testing. Objective: Many publications on model-based integration testing (MBIT) approaches can be found. Nevertheless, a study giving a systematic overview on the underlying software paradigms, measures for guiding the integration testing process as well as non-functional requirements they are suitable for, is missing. The aim of this paper is to find and synthesize the relevant primary studies to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of model-based integration testing. Method: For synthesizing the relevant studies, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) according to the guidelines of Kitchenham. Results: The systematic search and selection retrieved 83 relevant studies from which data has been extracted. Our review identified three assessment criteria for guiding the testing process, namely static metrics, dynamic metrics and stochastic &random. In addition it shows that just a small fraction considers non-functional requirements. Most approaches are for component-oriented systems. Conclusion: Results from the SLR show that there are two major research gaps. First, there is an accumulated need for approaches in the MBIT field that support non-functional requirements, as they are gaining importance. Second, means for steering the integration testing process, especially together with automation, need to evolve.

As an important research methodology in evidence-based software engineering, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are used for identifying the evidence and critically appraising the evidence, i.e. empirical studies that report (empirical) data about specific research questions. The 80/20 Rule (or Pareto's Law) reveals a 'vital few' phenomenon widely observed in many disciplines in the last century. However, the applicability of Pareto's Law to evidence distribution in software engineering (SE) is never tested yet. The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of Pareto's Law to the evidence distribution on specific topic areas in software engineering (in the form of systematic reviews), which may help us better understand the possible distribution of evidence in software engineering, and further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of literature search. We performed a tertiary study of SLRs in software engineering dated between 2004 and 2012. We further tested the Pareto's Law by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the distribution (over publication venues) of the primary studies reported in the existing SLRs. Our search identified 255 SLRs, 107 of which were included according to the selection criteria. The analysis of the extracted data from these SLRs presents a preliminary view of the evidence (study) distribution in software engineering. The nonuniform distribution of evidence is supported by the data from the existing SLRs in SE. However, the present observation reflects a weaker 'vital few' relation between study and venue than the 80/20 Rule statement. Top referenced venues are suggested when researchers search for studies in software engineering. It is also noticeable to the community that the primary studies are improperly or incompletely reported in many SLRs. © 2014 ACM.","evidence distribution; evidence-based software engineering; Pareto's Law (80/20 Rule); systematic (literature) review","Pareto principle; Research; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Evidence Based Software Engineering; evidence distribution; Non-uniform distribution; Pareto's Law (80/20 Rule); Research methodologies; Research questions; Systematic (literature) review; Software engineering",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450329651,,,"English","ACM Int.

Software engineering researchers conduct systematic literature reviews (SLRs) to build bodies of knowledge (BoKs). Unfortunately, relevant knowledge collected in the SLR process is not publicly available, which considerably slows down building BoKs incrementally. Objective. We present and evaluate the Systematic Knowledge Engineering (SKE) process to support efficiently building BoKs from published research. Method. SKE is based on the SLR process and on Knowledge Engineering practices to build a Knowledge Base (KB) by reusing intermediate data extraction results from SLRs. We evaluated the feasibility of applying SKE by building a Software Inspection BoK KB from published experiments and a Software Product Line BoK KB from published experience reports. We compared the effort, benefits, and risks of building BoK KBs regarding the SKE and the traditional SLR processes. Results. The application of SKE for incrementally collecting and organizing knowledge in the context of a BoK was feasible for different domains and different types of evidence. While the efforts for conducting the SKE and traditional SLR processes are comparable, SKE provides significant benefits for building BoKs. Conclusions. SKE enables researchers in a scientific community to reuse and incrementally build knowledge in a BoK. SKE is ready to be evaluated in other software engineering domains. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","body of knowledge; Empirical software engineering; software inspection; software product lines; systematic knowledge engineering; systematic review","Computer software; Computer software selection and evaluation; Inspection; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Publishing; Software design; Software engineering; Body of knowledge; Empirical Software Engineering; Software inspection; Software Product Line; Systematic Review; Buildings",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

A decade ago, Kitchenham, Dyb and Jørgensen argued that software engineering could benefit from an evidence-based research approach similar that that used in medicine, introducing the basis for Evidence Based Software Engineering (EBSE). Objective. Our main goal is to understand the evolution of the use of systematic reviews as the main research method in EBSE, as proposed by Kitchenham et al., by investigating primary and tertiary studies that explore any aspect, theory, or concept around the use of systematic reviews in software engineering. Method. A systematic mapping study protocol was used to find and selected studies about EBSE and systematic reviews in SE, published between 2004 and 2013. Results. We selected 52 unique papers classified as non-empirical studies (12), empirical studies (31), and tertiary studies (9). Conclusion. SLR has become an important component of software engineering research with nearly 200 unique reviews catalogued by the tertiary studies. Most important limitations are related to the industrial relevance and application of the results of reviews and the poor use of synthesis method to aggregate evidence © 2014 ACM.","evidence-based software engineering; mapping study; software engineering; systematic literature review","Evidence Based Software Engineering; Mapping studies; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Systematic Review; Software engineering","Santos, R.E.S.; Centre of Informatics, UFPE, Cidade UniversitáriaBrazil",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,9781450327749,,,"English","Int.

In order to correctly estimate, it is necessary to have a broad knowledge of the factors that influence effort estimation in Web projects. Aim: In this research we aim to increase the understanding of Web effort estimation by using a set of factors identified in literature along with the knowledge from experts in effort estimation. Method: We have gathered data from two different sources: (a) our previous work, in which we applied Grounded Theory procedures to identify factors that influence Web effort estimation from the point of view of Web project estimation experts; and (b) a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) extension, in which we identified factors reported in research papers. We have used the qualitative results from these sources to make comparisons and draw conclusions on factors affecting Web effort estimation. Results: We identified a total of 90 factors that influence effort estimation in Web projects. From this set, 30 factors were identified only in the qualitative study with experts in effort estimation, not being present in the SLR extension. Conclusions: By integrating the factors found in both our qualitative study with effort estimation experts and the SLR extension, we managed to create a comprehensive list of factors influencing effort estimation. Also, this set can be a starting point in the proposal of effort estimation models. Finally, the results from our comparison can be considered an indication that it is necessary to increase the employment of qualitative research to capture evidences regarding the current state of practice in Software Engineering.

A number of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have attempted to aggregate information from individual studies. Objective We wish to investigate GSD SLR research with a focus on discovering what research has been conducted in the area and to determine if the SLRs furnish appropriate risk and risk mitigation advice to provide guidance to organizations involved with GSD. Method We performed a broad automated search to identify GSD SLRs. Data extracted from each study included: (1) authors, their affiliation and publishing venue, (2) SLR quality, (3) research focus, (4) GSD risks, (5) risk mitigation strategies and, (6) for each SLR the number of primary studies reporting each risk and risk mitigation strategy. Results We found a total of 37 papers reporting 24 unique GSD SLR studies. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, (3) project planning and control and (4) project scope and requirements. We extracted 85 risks and 77 risk mitigation advice items and categorized them under four major headings: outsourcing rationale, software development, human resources, and project management. The largest group of risks was related to project management. GSD outsourcing rationale risks ranked highest in terms of primary study support but in many cases these risks were only identified by a single SLR. Conclusions The focus of the GSD SLRs we identified is mapping the research rather than providing evidence-based guidance to industry. Empirical support for the majority of risks identified is moderate to low, both in terms of the number of SLRs identifying the risk, and in the number of primary studies providing empirical support. Risk mitigation advice is also limited, and empirical support for these items is low.© 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, innovative strategies to rapidly increase coverage and recall rates for vaccinations are urgently required. Mobile text messaging (or short messaging service, SMS) has the potential to help increase vaccination coverage and therefore we propose to conduct a review of the current best evidence for the use of SMS as an intervention to promote vaccination coverage. Methods and analysis: This article describes the protocol for a systematic review of the effectiveness of SMS in improving the uptake of vaccination. Primary and secondary outcomes of interest are prespecified. We will preferably include randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, non-randomised studies (NRS) will be considered if there is an inadequate number of RCTs. We will search several bibliographic databases (eg,PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Science Citation Index, Africa-Wide Information and WHOLIS electronic databases and search sources for grey literature. Following data extraction and assessment of risk of bias, we will meta-analyse studies and conduct subgroup analyses, according to intervention subtypes. We will assess clinical heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity. For outcomes without quantitative data, a descriptive analysis will be used. This review protocol is registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of systematic reviews, registration number 2014:CRD42014007531 Ethics and dissemination: Ethics is not required for this study, given that this is a protocol for a systematic review, which uses published data. The findings of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. We anticipate that the results could be used by researchers and policymakers to help inform them of the efficacy of mobile phone text messaging interventions to promote increased vaccination coverage.

Both care environments are reported as being inappropriate and do not fulfill the needs of adolescents and young adults (AYA). The purpose of this study was to investigate supportive care needs (SCN) of AYA survivors of cancer. Methods: Qualitative description and a systematic literature review (SLR) were used to explore this topic. For the qualitative study, a purposive sample of AYA survivors (15 to 25 years of age) was recruited from a pediatric and an adult cancer program in one area of Ontario, Canada. Interviews were conducted, recorded digitally, and transcribed verbatim. Line-by-line coding was used to establish themes and subthemes. The SLR entailed a systematic search of electronic databases from their date of inception to October 2011. Two screeners worked independently to screen abstracts, titles, and relevant full-text articles. Findings from both studies were synthesized. Results: Twenty interviews were conducted for the qualitative study. For the SLR, 760 citations were identified, of which 12 met inclusion criteria. The most commonly reported SCN, from both studies, were social needs, information sharing and communication needs, and service provision needs.

Therefore, mechanisms to ensure model correctness become crucial, specially when applying MDE to the development of software, where software is the result of a chain of (semi)automatic model transformations that refine initial abstract models to lower level ones from which the final code is eventually generated. Clearly, in this context, an error in the model/s is propagated to the code endangering the soundness of the resulting software. Formal verification of software models is a promising approach that advocates the employment of formal methods to achieve model correctness, and it has received a considerable amount of attention in the last few years. Objective The objective of this paper is to analyze the state of the art in the field of formal verification of models, restricting the analysis to those approaches applied over static software models complemented or not with constraints expressed in textual languages, typically the Object Constraint Language (OCL). Method We have conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the published works in this field, describing their main characteristics. Results The study is based on a set of 48 resources that have been grouped in 18 different approaches according to their affinity. For each of them we have analyzed, among other issues, the formalism used, the support given to OCL, the correctness properties addressed or the feedback yielded by the verification process. Conclusions One of the most important conclusions obtained is that current model verification approaches are strongly influenced by the support given to OCL. Another important finding is that in general, current verification tools present important flaws like the lack of integration into the model designer tool chain or the lack of efficiency when verifying large, real-life models. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Secondary aims are to explore participants' acceptability and satisfaction with mobile phone interventions and to evaluate the selected studies in terms of study rigour, impact, cost and resource feasibility, generalizability and implications for nursing practice and research. Background: Medication non-adherence is a major global challenge. Mobile phones are the most commonly used form of technology worldwide and have the potential to promote medication adherence. Design: Guidelines from the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination were followed for this systematic review. Data Sources: A comprehensive search of databases (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Google Chrome and Cochrane) and bibliographies from related articles was performed from January 2002-January 2013 to identify the included studies. Review Methods: A quantitative systematic review without meta-analysis was conducted and the selected studies were critically evaluated to extract and summarize pertinent characteristics and outcomes. Results: The literature search produced 29 quantitative research studies related to mobile phones and medication adherence. The studies were conducted for prevention purposes as well as management of acute and chronic illnesses. All of the studies used text messaging. Eighteen studies found significant improvement in medication adherence. Conclusion: While the majority of investigators found improvement in medication adherence, long-term studies characterized by rigorous research methodologies, appropriate statistical and economic analyses and the test of theory-based interventions are needed to determine the efficacy of mobile phones to influence medication adherence. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Medication adherence; Mobile phone; Nursing; Short message service (SMS); Text messaging","drug therapy; human; mobile phone; patient compliance; Cell Phones; Drug Therapy; Humans; Patient Compliance","Park, L.G.; Division of Geriatrics, University of California, San Francisco VA Medical CenterUnited States; email: linda.park@ucsf.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",03092402,,JANUD,"24689978","English","J.

Recommendations on how to rigorously conduct such research are developed, strengths and limitations discussed, and opportunities for advancing the discipline through this approach identified. Design/methodology/approach – A systematic literature review (SLR) of 1,048 articles published in five leading SCM journals within a seven-year time frame is conducted. Findings – The review shows that multiple-informant studies are still largely under-represented. Yet this approach more accurately depicts the multi-faceted nature of SCM. Specific requirements of this approach need to be considered throughout the research process, from unit of analysis, sampling frame, and data collection to analytic strategy. Research limitations/implications – Taking into account the often complex, dynamic actor networks in which SCM phenomena are embedded may provide new insights, especially when controversial results have been found. This approach may also enrich the understanding of phenomena that have previously been examined only from a monadic perspective. Originality/value – The paper examines the low incidence of multiple-informant survey research in SCM, discusses how its application can advance the field, and provides guidance on how to effectively apply this approach to more fully understand complex SCM phenomena. It further shows that studies using multiple informants yield novel theoretical insights and valuable recommendations for decision makers on how to use the interfaces between different actors across functional and organizational borders. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Multiple informants; Research methods; Survey research; Systematic literature review",,"Kaufmann, L.; WHU – Otto Beisheim School of ManagementGermany",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",09600035,,,,"English","Int.

The goal of this process is to ensure that these systems will operate safely without posing undue risks to the user, the public, or the environment. Safety is typically ensured via complying with safety standards. Demonstrating compliance to these standards involves providing evidence to show that the safety criteria of the standards are met. Objective In order to cope with the complexity of large critical systems and subsequently the plethora of evidence information required for achieving compliance, safety professionals need in-depth knowledge to assist them in classifying different types of evidence, and in structuring and assessing the evidence. This paper is a step towards developing such a body of knowledge that is derived from a large-scale empirically rigorous literature review. Method We use a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the basis for our work. The SLR builds on 218 peer-reviewed studies, selected through a multi-stage process, from 4963 studies published between 1990 and 2012. Results We develop a taxonomy that classifies the information and artefacts considered as evidence for safety. We review the existing techniques for safety evidence structuring and assessment, and further study the relevant challenges that have been the target of investigation in the academic literature. We analyse commonalities in the results among different application domains and discuss implications of the results for both research and practice. Conclusion The paper is, to our knowledge, the largest existing study on the topic of safety evidence. The results are particularly relevant to practitioners seeking a better grasp on evidence requirements as well as to researchers in the area of system safety. As a major finding of the review, the results strongly suggest the need for more practitioner-oriented and industry-driven empirical studies in the area of safety certification. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions for active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected patients in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed with the following inclusion criteria: adult HIV patients treated with ART, an intervention to enhance patient adherence, adherence rate as an outcome, a clinical or patient outcome, a randomised controlled trial and conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Studies were selected by two reviewers independently. Data on patient characteristics, interventions, adherence definition and measures, and results were extracted. The risk of bias was evaluated by two reviewers independently. A meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. All discrepancies were discussed until consensus. Results: Six trials fulfilled all inclusion criteria. One showed statistically significant results in favour of the intervention for adherence rate and clinical outcome. The other studies showed either no significant results for any outcome or heterogeneous results depending on the outcome type. Aside from the clinical outcomes in one study, all outcomes showed a tendency in favour of the intervention groups. In the meta-analysis short message service (SMS) interventions showed a statistically significant effect on adherence (risk difference≤-0.10; 95% confidence interval (CI):-0.17 to-0.03) and modified directly observed therapy (DOT) showed a significant effect on mortality (relative risk≤0.75; 95% CI: 0.44-1.26). Conclusion: The adherence-enhancing interventions (DOT, SMS interventions, counselling plus an alarm device) increased adherence only slightly, possibly because the high baseline adherence causes a ceiling effect. © 2014 CSIRO.","AIDS; directly observed therapy; HIV; SMS; text messaging.","anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; Africa south of the Sahara; antiviral therapy; comparative study; directly observed therapy; drug efficacy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; meta analysis; mortality; patient compliance; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; systematic review; treatment outcome","Mathes, T.; Institute for Research in Operative Medicine, School of Medicine, Witten/Herdecke University, Ostmerheimer Str. 200, D-51109 Cologne, Germany; email: tim.mathes@uni-wh.de",,"CSIRO",14485028,,,,"English","Sex.

However, there is no attempt to systematically review and classify the VTs and associated tools reported for SA, and how they have been assessed and applied. Objective This work aimed at systematically reviewing the literature on software architecture visualization to develop a classification of VTs in SA, analyze the level of reported evidence and the use of different VTs for representing SA in different application domains, and identify the gaps for future research in the area. Method We used systematic literature review (SLR) method of the evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) for reviewing the literature on VTs for SA. We used both manual and automatic search strategies for searching the relevant papers published between 1 February 1999 and 1 July 2011. Results We selected 53 papers from the initially retrieved 23,056 articles for data extraction, analysis, and synthesis based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results from the data analysis enabled us to classify the identified VTs into four types based on the usage popularity: graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based VTs. The VTs in SA are mostly used for architecture recovery and architectural evolution activities. We have also identified ten purposes of using VTs in SA. Our results also revealed that VTs in SA have been applied to a wide range of application domains, among which ""graphics software"" and ""distributed system"" have received the most attention. Conclusion SA visualization has gained significant importance in understanding and evolving software-intensive systems. However, only a few VTs have been employed in industrial practice. This review has enabled us to identify the following areas for further research and improvement: (i) it is necessary to perform more research on applying visualization techniques in architectural analysis, architectural synthesis, architectural implementation, and architecture reuse activities; (ii) it is essential to pay more attention to use more objective evaluation methods (e.g., controlled experiment) for providing more convincing evidence to support the promised benefits of using VTs in SA; (iii) it is important to conduct industrial surveys for investigating how software architecture practitioners actually employ VTs in architecting process and what are the issues that hinder and prevent them from adopting VTs in SA. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.","Software architecture; Software architecture visualization; Visualization techniques","Research; Visualization; Architectural design decisions; Architecture visualization; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Inclusion and exclusions; Large-scale complex systems; Software intensive systems; Systematic literature review (SLR); Visualization technique; Software architecture","Liang, P.; State Key Lab of Software Engineering, School of Computer, Wuhan UniversityChina; email: liangp@whu.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Inc.",01641212,,JSSOD,,"English","J Syst Software",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902547442

It helps stakeholders understand the many associations of software artifacts created during a software development project. End-to-end traceability refers to linkage of all artifacts in the entire lifecycle of a software development project. Its goal is to provide stakeholders of the software development with trace information in order to analyze impacts due to changes in a software system. Compared to that of a single product, the end-to-end traceability of software product line is more complicated because Software Product Line Development (SPLD) requires two separate but intimately related phases of domain engineering and application engineering. Various SPLD traceability approaches have been proposed in the past. However, thus far no research work on SPLD traceability has focused on SPLD end-to-end traceability. This paper defines SPLD end-to-end traceability and evaluates the existing SPLD traceability approaches from SPLD end-to-end traceability perspectives. We surveyed studies on SPLD traceability methods, traceability mechanisms used in major SPLD approaches, and software traceability survey papers. We compared the existing SPLD traceability approaches based on Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Through the survey, we found that none of the SPLD traceability studies fully supports SPLD end-to-end traceability, and there are unexplored research areas of SPLD end-to-end traceability in the existing SPLD traceability studies. The contribution of this paper is that it presents future research directions that give research guidelines for each unexplored research area in SPLD end-to-end traceability. Finally, based on the research directions, this paper suggests future research opportunities for SPLD end-to-end traceability. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.","software product line development; software product line traceability; Software traceability","Application programs; Computer software; Engineering research; Life cycle; Surveys; Application engineering; Future research directions; Research opportunities; Software development projects; Software Product Line; Software product line development; Software traceability; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

Objective: The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the use of eHealth interventions for HIV prevention in high-risk MSM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, OVID, ISI Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and Google for articles and grey literature reporting the original results of any studies related to HIV prevention in MSM and developed a standard data collection form to extract information on study characteristics and outcome data. Results: In total, 13 articles met the inclusion criteria, of which five articles targeted HIV testing behaviors and eight focused on decreasing HIV risk behaviors. Interventions included Web-based education modules, text messaging (SMS, short message service), chat rooms, and social networking. The methodological quality of articles ranged from 49.4-94.6%. Wide variation in the interventions meant synthesis of the results using meta-analysis would not be appropriate. Conclusions: This review shows evidence that eHealth for HIV prevention in high-risk MSM has the potential to be effective in the short term for reducing HIV risk behaviors and increasing testing rates. Given that many of these studies were short term and had other limitations, but showed strong preliminary evidence of improving outcomes, additional work needs to rigorously assess the use of eHealth strategies for HIV prevention in high-risk MSM.","EHealth; High-risk MSM; HIV prevention; HIV risk behaviors; HIV testing; Internet; SMS","health behavior; health education; health promotion; high risk behavior; HIV Infections; human; Internet; male; male homosexuality; procedures; risk reduction; telemedicine; text messaging; Health Behavior; Health Education; Health Promotion; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Internet; Male; Risk Reduction Behavior; Risk-Taking; Telemedicine; Text Messaging","Schnall, R.; Columbia University, School of Nursing, 617 West 168th Street, New York, NY, United States; email: rb897@columbia.edu",,"Journal of Medical Internet Research",14388871,,,"24862459","English","J.

Change impact analysis and propagation have been identified as a potential research area in this context. This study is part of a larger study to systematically review all available research on impact analysis and propagation in context of Business process management (BPM) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Preliminary results have been reported by answering 2 selected research Questions. 43 studies were selected out of initial set of 182 research articles. Studies answering selected research questions have been included in this report. BPM is considered at Business Level for Business operations and Process Models, while SOA is considered as a Deployment Architecture at service level.

The role of social media (SM) in helping medical students and doctors achieve clinical excellence is unknown. Social media may help facilitate the achievement of clinical excellence Purpose: This report aimed to identify examples of how SM may be used to help promote the achievement of clinical excellence in medical learners. Methods: Three of the authors previously conducted a systematic review of the published literature on SM use in undergraduate, graduate and continuing medical education. Two authors re-examined the 14 evaluative studies to identify any examples of SM use that may facilitate the achievement of clinical excellence and to consider whether there were any aspects of clinical excellence for which no studies had been performed, and, if so, whether SM was relevant to these domains. Results: Each study touched on one or more of the following domains of clinical excellence: communication and interpersonal skills; professionalism and humanism; knowledge diagnostic acumen; exhibiting a passion for patient care; a scholarly approach to clinical practice; and explicitly modelling expertise to medical trainees. No study addressed the role of SM to promote the skillful negotiation of the health care system, and in collaboration with investigators to advance science and discovery; however, additional evidence suggested that SM may play an adjunctive role in promoting the achievement of these aspects of clinical excellence. Conclusion: This report supports the hypothesis that SM may help facilitate the achievement of clinical excellence; however, further research is needed into the role of SM in promoting the achievement of clinical excellence. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"adult; attitude to health; clinical competence; doctor patient relation; female; human; human relation; humanism; interpersonal communication; male; medical education; middle aged; patient care; physician; procedures; professional competence; psychology; social media; young adult; Adult; Clinical Competence; Communication; Education, Medical; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humanism; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Care; Physician-Patient Relations; Physicians; Professional Competence; Social Media; Young Adult","Flickinger, T.; Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 2024 E.

Health behavior change theories and user input are identified as important contributors in the effectiveness of the interventions, but they are rarely combined in a systematic way in the design of the interventions. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the appropriate theoretical framework, along with the needs of the users of a physical activity intervention for cardiac rehabilitation, and to combine them into an effective Internet- and mobile-based intervention. Methods: We explain the theoretical framework of the intervention in a narrative overview of the existing health behavior change literature as it applies to physical activity. We also conducted a focus group with 11 participants of a cardiac rehabilitation program and used thematic analysis to identify and analyze patterns of meaning in the transcribed data. Results: We chose stage-based approaches, specifically the transtheoretical model and the health action process approach as our main framework for tailoring, supplemented with other theoretical concepts such as regulatory focus within the appropriate stages. From the thematic analysis of the focus group data, we identified seven themes: (1) social, (2) motivation, (3) integration into everyday life, (4) information, (5) planning, (6) monitoring and feedback, and (7) concerns and potential problems. The final design of the intervention was based on both the theoretical review and the user input, and it is explained in detail. Conclusions: We applied a combination of health behavioral theory and user input in designing our intervention. We think this is a promising design approach with the potential to combine the high efficacy of theory-based interventions with the higher perceived usefulness of interventions designed according to user input.

In MBT, test cases can be derived from different models, also from the popularly used UML diagrams. Different UML diagrams include various important pieces of information that can be successfully used in a testing procedure. A lot of papers present approaches for test case generation from different UML diagrams and researchers are trying to find the most optimal one. In this paper, we present the first results of a systematic literature review in the area of test case generation from UML diagrams. Based on research questions, we explored which UML diagrams are most commonly used for test case generation, what approaches are presented in the literature, their pros and cons and connections with different testing levels. We also tried to find approaches that are tailored to test mobile applications. First results show that UML state machine, activity, sequence diagram and of course, a combination of more UML diagrams, are most commonly used for test case generation. Different approaches are used for generation, like graphs, trees, tables, labelled transition systems (LTS), genetics algorithms (GA), finite state machines (FSM) and others. The found approaches have many advantages, but also some disadvantages such as a lack of automatization, problems with complex diagrams and others.

This paper aims to evaluate compliance with these guidelines by assessing the usability recommendations of a set of 24 selected mobile PHR applications. An analysis process based on a well-known Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol was used. The results show that the 24 mobile PHR applications studied are not suitably structured. 46 % of these applications do not use any of the recommended patterns, using instead lists or springboards, which are deprecated patterns for top-level menus. 70 % of the PHRs require a registration to be able to test the application when these interactions should be delayed.

Owing to its rarity and unfavorable outcome, we investigated its general features on MRI and incidence in the context of lupus activity, to facilitate early recognition and treatment. Methods: We report a case of a young man with clinically inactive lupus nephritis but who presented with a sudden attack of myelitis. We performed systematic literature search in Medline to study the clinical features of SLE-related TM. Results: From 1960 to April 2013, a total of 72 articles containing 194 cases of lupus myelitis were found. Among acquired articles, 93 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The majority of the cases (88.8%) were female. Longitudinal myelitis was the predominant imaging finding on MRI (71.4%, 45/63). Nearly two-thirds (61/94) of lupus myelitis occurred in association with active lupus, and one-third (33/94) occurred in low disease activity. Conclusions: Upon literature review, we found myelitis in SLE more frequently manifested as longitudinal on MRI. Although lupus myelitis often presented at an active phase of SLE, one-third of events happened in the presence of low disease activity. Early initiation of effective immunosuppressive therapy facilitated recovery.","Lupus nephritis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Myelopathy; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Transverse myelitis","antinuclear antibody; antithrombocytic agent; cardiolipin antibody; citicoline; complement component C3; complement component C4; creatinine; cyclophosphamide; double stranded DNA antibody; immunoglobulin; mannitol; methylprednisolone; mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester; prednisone; Sm antibody; steroid; adult; albumin blood level; antibody titer; Article; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; creatinine blood level; disease activity; disease association; drug pulse therapy; female; foot edema; human; immunosuppressive treatment; incidence; longitudinal study; lupus erythematosus nephritis; male; Medline; myelitis; nephrotic syndrome; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paresthesia; photosensitivity; priority journal; proteinuria; rash; SLEDAI; systemic lupus erythematosus; thorax radiography; treatment duration; weakness; case report; complication; lupus erythematosus nephritis; Myelitis, Transverse; pathophysiology; severity of illness index; systemic lupus erythematosus; Adult; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Lupus Nephritis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myelitis, Transverse; Severity of Illness Index","Pai, P.; Department of Nephrology, University of Hong Kong Shenzhen HospitalChina; email: ppai@hku-szh.org",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",09612033,,LUPUE,"24972897","English","Lupus",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928119390

In consequence, the taste, motivations and process of luxury goods purchasing differ from the buying process of everyday consumer products. Possessing luxury products is the ultimate desire of many consumers in the international market and the demand for these products is increasing very quickly, especially in the advanced emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). According to Anestis et al. (2009), China will be the biggest market for luxury products in 2015. The latest data following the economic crises of 2008-2010 show that China’s share in luxury goods consumption rose to 27 percent (Deloitte, 2009; Accenture, 2009) and became the leading market at the beginning of 2013 (Jing Daily, 2012). Together, Asian countries are becoming the destination for 60 percent (Chevalier and Lu, 2010) of the world’s luxury products. It is vital for luxury goods producers to know and understand the buying behaviors of Asian luxury goods consumers, especially the affluent Chinese and new consumers of luxury goods. Rapid economic growth, public policy and cultural factors have made the Chinese affluent customers who are different from their peers in the most developed markets in the West, as well as in the East (i.e., Japan). Despite the ever-increasing opportunity of marketing luxury goods in China, academic research on Chinese affluent consumers’ buying process is rare. The purpose of this chapter is to fill this gap and to propose an effective business model for prospective and existing luxury goods exporters to China. This chapter is based on a systematic literature review (SLR) and a content analysis of existing academic publications and professional reports. First of all, we will provide a definition of a luxury good and how the buying process of this product differs in China from socio-economic and cultural points of view. Then we will present our methodology, which will be followed by theoretical propositions and discussion on challenges and strategies of marketing luxury goods in emerging China. © 2014 selection and editorial material, Elie Virgile Chrysostome and Rick Molz; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781136168857; 9780415643177,,,"English","Building Businesses in Emerg. and Developing Ctries.: Challenges and Opportunities",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086212462

This study was performed to determine the prevalence of and associated risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Latin American (LA) patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods. First, a cross-sectional analytical study was conducted in 310 Colombian patients with SLE in whom CVD was assessed. Associated factors were examined by multivariate regression analyses. Second, a systematic review of the literature on CVD in SLE in LA was performed. Results. There were 133 (36.5%) Colombian SLE patients with CVD. Dyslipidemia, smoking, coffee consumption, and pleural effusion were positively associated with CVD. An independent effect of coffee consumption and cigarette on CVD was found regardless of gender and duration of disease. In the systematic review, 60 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included. A wide range of CVD prevalence was found (4%-79.5%). Several studies reported ancestry, genetic factors, and polyautoimmunity as novel risk factors for such a condition. Conclusions. A high rate of CVD is observed in LA patients with SLE. Awareness of the observed risk factors should encourage preventive population strategies for CVD in patients with SLE aimed at facilitating the suppression of cigarette smoking and coffee consumption as well as at the tight control of dyslipidemia and other modifiable risk factors. © 2013 Jenny Amaya-Amaya et al.",,"antimalarial agent; antinuclear antibody; azathioprine; C reactive protein; complement component C3; complement component C4; creatinine; cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody; cytotoxic agent; hair dye; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; La antibody; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; lupus anticoagulant; methotrexate; mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester; pesticide; rheumatoid factor; ribonucleoprotein antibody; rituximab; Ro antibody; Sm antibody; steroid; thyroglobulin antibody; thyroid peroxidase antibody; thyrotropin; triacylglycerol; age; alopecia; anemia; arthropathy; article; atherosclerosis; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; clinical assessment; coffee; comorbidity; creatinine blood level; creatinine clearance; cross-sectional study; depression; discoid lupus erythematosus; disease activity; disease duration; dyslipidemia; education; epilepsy; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; family history; fibromyalgia; gender; glomerulonephritis; hand edema; headache; hepatitis A; heredity; Hispanic; housewife; human; hyperhomocysteinemia; hypertension; inflammation; leukopenia; livedo reticularis; lung embolism; lupus erythematosus nephritis; lymphocytopenia; malaria; nephritis; nephrotic syndrome; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; occupation; onset age; osteoporosis; peptic ulcer; pericarditis; pleura effusion; prevalence; priority journal; proteinuria; psychosis; pulmonary hypertension; pyuria; sedentary lifestyle; smoking; social status; spontaneous abortion; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; thrombocytopenia; triacylglycerol blood level; vascular disease; vasculitis; venereal disease reaction test","Amaya-Amaya, J.; Center for Autoimmune Diseases Research (CREA), School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universidad Del Rosario, Carrera 24 No. 63C-69, 111221 Bogotá, Colombia; email: jecamaya@gmail.com",,,20900430,,,,"English","Autoimmune Dis.",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888876526

Missed appointments are a major cause of inefficiency in healthcare delivery with substantial monetary costs for the health system, leading to delays in diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Patients' forgetfulness is one of the main reasons for missed appointments. Patient reminders may help reduce missed appointments. Modes of communicating reminders for appointments to patients include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, and mobile phone messaging. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), could provide an important, inexpensive delivery medium for reminders for healthcare appointments. Objectives: To update our review assessing the effects of mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments. Secondary objectives include assessment of costs; health outcomes; patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation of the intervention and perceptions of safety; and possible harms and adverse effects associated with the intervention. Search methods: Original searches were run in June 2009. For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to August 2012) and CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to August 2012). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing mobile phone messaging as reminders for healthcare appointments. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third author. Two authors assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. As the intervention characteristics and outcome measures were similar across included studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to estimate an overall effect size. Main results: We included eight randomised controlled trials involving 6615 participants. Four of these studies were newly identified during this update. We found moderate quality evidence from seven studies (5841 participants) that mobile text message reminders improved the rate of attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders (risk ratio (RR) 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.26)). There was also moderate quality evidence from three studies (2509 participants) that mobile text message reminders had a similar impact to phone call reminders (RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.02). Low quality evidence from one study (291 participants) suggests that mobile text message reminders combined with postal reminders improved the rate of attendance at healthcare appointments compared to postal reminders alone (RR 1.10 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.19)). Overall, the attendance to appointment rates were 67.8% for the no reminders group, 78.6% for the mobile phone messaging reminders group and 80.3% for the phone call reminders group. One study reported generally that there were no adverse effects during the study period; none of the studies reported in detail on specific adverse events such as loss of privacy, data misinterpretation, or message delivery failure. Two studies reported that the costs per text message per attendance were respectively 55% and 65% lower than costs per phone call reminder. The studies included in the review did not report on health outcomes or people's perceptions of safety related to receiving reminders by text message. Authors' conclusions: Low to moderate quality evidence included in this review shows that mobile phone text messaging reminders increase attendance at healthcare appointments compared to no reminders, or postal reminders. Text messaging reminders were similar to telephone reminders in terms of their effect on attendance rates, and cost less than telephone reminders. However, the included studies were heterogeneous and the quality of the evidence therein is low to moderate. Further, there is a lack of information about health effects, adverse effects and harms, user evaluation of the intervention and user perceptions of its safety. The current evidence therefore still remains insufficient to conclusively inform policy decisions. There is a need for more high-quality randomised trials of mobile phone messaging reminders, that measure not only patients' attendance rates, but also focus on the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Health outcomes, patients' and healthcare providers' evaluation and perceptions of the safety of the interventions, potential harms, and adverse effects of mobile phone messaging reminders should be assessed. Studies should report message content and timing in relation to the appointment. © 2013 The Cochrane Collaboration.

The starting point of a SLR should be a problem from the practice and the results should, somehow, have an impact on improving practice. Objective: To investigate the motivation of software engineering researchers to conduct a SLR and how the results of their reviews are potentially impacting the software engineering practice. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with authors of 120 SLRs published between 2004 and 2010 identified by three tertiary studies previously published. Results: Forty-four authors of SLR participate in the survey. The motivation behind the vast majority of the SLRs was to gather knowledge about a particular field of study. However, only six participants affirmed that their reviews actually had a direct impact in industrial practice. Conclusions: The use of SLR has increased over the years but they were mostly focused on academic problems and had very little impact on industrial practice. Therefore, the full potential benefits of evidence-based software engineering are not being achieved. © 2013 IEEE.","empirical software engineering; evidence based software engineering; survey research; systematic literature reviews","Cross-sectional surveys; Empirical Software Engineering; Evidence based researches; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Industrial practices; Software engineering practices; Survey research; Systematic literature review; Industrial management; Motivation; Research; Surveys; Software engineering","Centre for Informatics (CIn), Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Cidade Universitária, Recife, Brazil",,,19493770,,,,"English","Int.

Methods: A search of Medline, Embase and Web of Science was performed, with papers included if they met the requirements of containing keywords relating to SLE and damage assessment using the SDI, published between 1990 and October 2012. Results: A total of 358 articles were identified, with 50 included in this review. From 17 studies reporting damage at more than 2 time points, damage progressed over time, but the rate of damage accrual reported was variable across studies. Demographic factors that influence the accrual of damage in several reports include male gender, older age, longer disease duration, Afro-Caribbean and Indo-Asian ethnicity. Patients with higher disease activity at a single time point or over time accrue greater damage. Certain organ system involvement also predicts damage accrual, in particular renal and neuropsychiatric involvement. Corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine all show an association with damage accrual, while hydroxychloroquine appears to have a ""protective"" effect. Four studies, which examined prognosis, all demonstrated that damage is a predictor of future mortality. Conclusions: Damage in SLE patients increases over time and predicts future mortality. Patients at risk of damage can be identified from demographics factors and the pattern of clinical involvement. Disease activity, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are also associated with future damage but further studies are needed to separate the mechanisms of these associations from the problem of residual confounding. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Damage; Epidemiology; Europe; Prevalence; Systemic lupus erythematosus","azathioprine; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; double stranded DNA antibody; hydroxychloroquine; methylprednisolone; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; phospholipid antibody; Sm antibody; transforming growth factor beta1; African Caribbean; age; article; Asian; disease activity; disease duration; ethnic difference; human; immunosuppressive treatment; lupus erythematosus nephritis; mental disease; mortality; neurologic disease; neuropsychiatric disease; priority journal; prognosis; sex difference; SLEDAI; social psychology; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; Damage; Epidemiology; Europe; Prevalence; Systemic lupus erythematosus; Age Factors; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Prognosis; Severity of Illness Index","Sutton, E.J.; Arthritis Research UK Epidemiology Unit, Centre for Musculoskeletal Research, Institute of Inflammation and Repair, The University of Manchester, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, Rutherford House, Manchester Science Park, 40 Pencroft Way, Manchester M15 6SZ, United Kingdom; email: emily.sutton@manchester.ac.uk",,,00490172,,SAHRB,"23786872","English","Semin.

Research has shown that mHealth initiatives, or health programs enhanced by mobile phone technologies, can foster women's empowerment. Yet, there is growing concern that mobile-based programs geared towards women may exacerbate gender inequalities. Methods. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the empirical evidence of changes in men and women's interactions as a result of mHealth interventions. To be eligible, studies had to have been published in English from 2002 to 2012, conducted in a developing country, included an evaluation of a mobile health intervention, and presented findings on resultant dynamics between women and men. The search strategy comprised four electronic bibliographic databases in addition to a manual review of the reference lists of relevant articles and a review of organizational websites and journals with recent mHealth publications. The methodological rigor of selected studies was appraised by two independent reviewers who also abstracted data on the study's characteristics. Iterative thematic analyses were used to synthesize findings relating to gender-transformative and non-transformative experiences. Results: Out of the 173 articles retrieved for review, seven articles met the inclusion criteria and were retained in the final analysis. Most mHealth interventions were SMS-based and conducted in sub-Saharan Africa on topics relating to HIV/AIDS, sexual and reproductive health, health-based microenterprise, and non-communicable diseases. Several methodological limitations were identified among eligible quantitative and qualitative studies. The current literature suggests that mobile phone programs can influence gender relations in meaningfully positive ways by providing new modes for couple's health communication and cooperation and by enabling greater male participation in health areas typically targeted towards women. MHealth initiatives also increased women's decision-making, social status, and access to health resources. However, programmatic experiences by design may inadvertently reinforce the digital divide, and perpetuate existing gender-based power imbalances. Domestic disputes and lack of spousal approval additionally hampered women's participation. Conclusion: Efforts to scale-up health interventions enhanced by mobile technologies should consider the implementation and evaluation imperative of ensuring that mHealth programs transform rather than reinforce gender inequalities. The evidence base on the effect of mHealth interventions on gender relations is weak, and rigorous research is urgently needed. © 2013 Jennings and Gagliardi; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Access; Developing countries; Equity; Gender relations; Literature review; mHealth; Mobile phone technology; Women","database; developing world; empowerment; gender disparity; health services; literature review; mobile communication; technology adoption; womens health; womens status; Africa south of the Sahara; developing country; empowerment; family planning; financial management; gender; health program; human; human relation; mobile phone; priority journal; reproductive health; review; sexual health; systematic review; telemedicine; Sub-Saharan Africa; Cellular Phone; Community Health Services; Developing Countries; Empirical Research; Female; Health Information Systems; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Sexual Partners; Telemedicine","Jennings, L.; Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, United States; email: ljenning@jhsph.edu",,,14759276,,,"24131553","English","Int.

Objectives: Increasing studies on SM indicates the interest of researchers to this subject. Almost all human body organs are at risk for complications of SM. This study offers organ-by-organ information on the effects of SM in animals and humans. Methods: The data sources were literature reviews since 1919 as well as our studies during the Iraq-Iran war. The search items were SM and its all other nomenclatures in relation to, in vivo, in vitro, humans, animals, eye, ocular, ophthalmic, lungs, pulmonary, skin, cutaneous, organs and systemic. Amongst more than 1890 SM-related articles, 257 more relevant clinicopathologic papers were selected for this review. Results: SM induces a vast range of damages in nearly all organs. Acute SM intoxication warrants immediate approach. Among chronic lesions, delayed keratitis and blindness, bronchiolitis obliterans and respiratory distress, skin pruritus, dryness and cancers are the most commonly observed clinical sequelae. Conclusion: Ocular involvements in a number of patients progress toward a severe, rapid onset form of keratitis. Progressive deterioration of respiratory tract leads to ""mustard lung"". Skin problems continue as chronic frustrating pruritus on old scars with susceptibility to skin cancers. Due to the multiple acute and chronic morbidities created by SM exposure, uses of multiple drugs by several routes of administrations are warranted. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Clinicopathologic; Complication; Cutaneous; Ocular; Organs; Pulmonary; Sulfur mustard","3 aminobenzamide; acetylcysteine; antibiotic agent; antiglaucoma agent; antihistaminic agent; antioxidant; artificial tear; betamethasone; bronchodilating agent; cell DNA; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; gamma interferon; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; immunoglobulin G; kalinin; mucolytic agent; mustard gas; nicotinamide; pimecrolimus; prednisolone; sodium thiosulfate; steroid; vitamin; acute lung injury; adjuvant therapy; antibiotic therapy; article; blepharitis; blood toxicity; bone marrow suppression; burning sensation; cardiovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; cornea neovascularization; cytotoxicity; DNA alkylation; dry skin; ear nose throat disease; endocrine disease; eye injury; eye toxicity; gas poisoning; genotoxicity; glaucoma; human; immunoglobulin blood level; in vitro study; intoxication; lung complication; lung fibrosis; lung toxicity; lymphatic system disease; mental disease; metabolic disorder; musculoskeletal disease; neurological complication; nonhuman; organ injury; photophobia; pruritus; reproductive toxicity; respiratory tract inflammation; skin toxicity; spleen disease; steroid therapy; systematic review; teratogenicity; urinary tract disease; Animals; Cardiovascular System; Chemical Warfare Agents; Eye; Humans; Immune System; Mustard Gas; Nervous System; Reproduction; Respiratory System; Skin","Ghasemi, H.; Department of Ophthalmology, Medical School, Shahed University, P.O Box: 14155-7435, Tehran, Iran; email: ghasemi518@yahoo.com",,,15569527,,,"23590683","English","Cutaneous Ocul.

A comprehensive systematic review of how mobile technology has been used for measuring PA and promoting PA behavior change is needed. Evidence acquisition: Article collection was conducted using six databases from February to June 2012 with search terms related to mobile technology and PA. Articles that described the use of mobile technologies for PA assessment, sedentary behavior assessment, and/or interventions for PA behavior change were included. Articles were screened for inclusion and study information was extracted. Evidence synthesis: Analyses were conducted from June to September 2012. Mobile phone-based journals and questionnaires, short message service (SMS) prompts, and on-body PA sensing systems were the mobile technologies most utilized. Results indicate that mobile journals and questionnaires are effective PA self-report measurement tools. Intervention studies that reported successful promotion of PA behavior change employed SMS communication, mobile journaling, or both SMS and mobile journaling. Conclusions: mHealth technologies are increasingly being employed to assess and intervene on PA in clinical, epidemiologic, and intervention research. The wide variations in technologies used and outcomes measured limit comparability across studies, and hamper identification of the most promising technologies. Further, the pace of technologic advancement currently outstrips that of scientific inquiry. New adaptive, sequential research designs that take advantage of ongoing technology development are needed. At the same time, scientific norms must shift to accept ""smart,"" adaptive, iterative, evidence-based assessment and intervention technologies that will, by nature, improve during implementation. © 2013 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.",,"article; behavior change; feasibility study; health promotion; interpersonal communication; intervention study; medical assessment; medical literature; medical technology; mobile phone; physical activity; quality control; questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; self report; Cellular Phone; Exercise; Health Promotion; Humans; Microcomputers; Telemedicine; User-Computer Interface","O'Reilly, G.A.; Department of Preventive Medicine, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, 2001 N.

Although this procedure seems easier, many caveats remain, especially in terms of leakage. Other serious complications include strictures, bleeding, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Strictures are related to operative technique but also to healed leaks and fistulas. To our knowledge, the literature reports on the physiopathology and management of strictures after LSG are scarce. Methods: A retrospective analysis of our database provided a total of 16 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of strictures. A comprehensive review of each case was done including their management. Results: Sixteen patients were treated laparoscopically for strictures. There were eight females (mean age, 40.6 years). Most common complaints were dysphagia (n = 14) and/or GERD (n = 8). Body Mass Index was 30.5 kg/m2 ± 9.3. Fourteen patients underwent a seromyotomy (SM) and two a wedge resection of the stenosis. After SM, morbidity included five leaks on the short term and five reoperations in the long-term. Of the 16 patients, 12 were treated satisfactorily, three required endoscopies and one had minimal GERD symptoms. Conclusions: Strictures and stenosis can be managed by laparoscopic approach with acceptable results. SM can be useful but carries a high complication rate. Accurate technique with parsimonious use of coagulation and possibly with the systematic use of an omental patch might lead to better results. The wedge resection of the stomach including the stricture was performed successfully in two cases. In addition, wedge resection was used secondarily in two other cases to address a complication of the seromyotomy. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Complications; Conversion to gastric bypass; Management; Morbid obesity; Resection; Seromyotomy; Sleeve gastrectomy; Stenosis; Stricture; Wedge resection","adult; anastomosis leakage; anastomosis stenosis; article; body mass; clinical article; data base; dysphagia; female; gastroesophageal reflux; gastroscopy; human; laparoscopic surgery; male; morbidity; obesity; postoperative complication; priority journal; reoperation; retrospective study; seromyotomy; sleeve gastrectomy; stomach obstruction; stomach surgery; surgical technique; treatment outcome; wedge resection; Adult; Anastomosis, Surgical; Belgium; Body Mass Index; Constriction, Pathologic; Deglutition Disorders; Female; Gastric Bypass; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity, Morbid; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Suture Techniques; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss","Vilallonga, R.; Division of Bariatric Surgery, AZ St-Blasius, Kroonveldlaan 52, 9200 Dendermonde, Belgium; email: vilallongapuy@hotmail.com",,,09608923,,OBSUE,"23702907","English","Obes.

It ensures a more cost-efficient usage of resources while preserving a smooth flow of goods across international borders. Hence, customs administrations are challenged to favor the introduction of IT systems that may enhance the ability to improve information sharing with the business sector, as well as with other governmental agencies. This is often not a straightforward process. As many experts point out, e-Government development projects fail commonly due to the lack of thorough understanding of administration requirements as well as barriers for implementation. Hence, the purpose of this study is to understand what factors enable or hinder the exploitation of e-Customs platforms. By means of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), a theoretical framework is developed to identify drivers and barriers for usage of e-Government/e-Customs platforms. Thereby, a survey instrument was developed and data was collected in occasion of a World Customs Organization (WCO) Annual Council meeting, which was joined by around 400 customs delegates and officers from 178 WCO member administrations. A total of 94 questionnaires have been collected and analyzed, which gives an approximate response rate of 23% (46% considering only the 178 member administrations). The analysis of data has been performed by a combination of multivariate techniques and ANOVA. Results show that factors like cost-savings and ease of use significantly influence the usage of e-Customs platforms. On the contrary, cost-efficiency and usefulness of e-Customs platforms have no significant impacts. From the perspective of barriers preventing adoption, this paper identifies two main factors: 1) technical constraints and costs and 2) quality and trust. Both these factors significantly influence adoption of information sharing, in the context of business-customs communication. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.","Drivers and barriers; E-Customs; E-Government; Information sharing; Security; Single window; Trade facilitation",,"Urciuoli, L.; University of Borås, School of Engineering, Järnvägsgatan 10, 501 90 Borås, Sweden; email: luca.urciuoli@gmail.com",,,0740624X,,GIQUE,,"English","Gov.

Objective Presenting the results of a study undertaken to seek and assess PL approaches for BPM through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Moreover, identifying the existence of dynamic PL approaches for BPM. Method A SLR was conducted with four research questions formulated to evaluate PL approaches for BPM. Results 63 papers were selected as primary studies according to the criteria established. From these primary studies, only 15 papers address the specific dynamic aspects in the context evaluated. Moreover, it was found that PLs only partially address the BPM lifecycle since the last business process phase is not a current concern on the found approaches. Conclusions The found PL approaches for BPM only cover partially the BPM lifecycle, not taking into account the last phase which restarts the lifecycle. Moreover, no wide dynamic PL proposal was found for BPM, but only the treatment of specific dynamic aspects.

Researchers are examining innovative techniques including the use of mobile technology to promote physical activity. One such technology, text messaging, is emerging internationally as a method to communicate with and motivate individuals to engage in healthy behaviors, including physical activity. Aim: Review the existing scientific literature on adult physical activity text messaging interventions. Methods: This systematic review examined research papers that addressed physical activity text messaging intervention studies in adults. Using multiple databases, the search strategy included published English language studies through October 1, 2011. An author-developed data collection tool was used independently by two reviewers to extract and examine the selected study variables. Results: The initial search resulted in the identification of 200 publications. Eleven publications representing 10 studies were included in the final review. Studies were conducted in seven countries with over half the studies being randomized controlled trials. Participants of the studies were predominantly young to middle aged women. Physical activity data were mainly obtained by self-report although three studies used pedometers or accelerometers. Interventions ranged from only sending out text messages to combining text messages with educational materials, staff support, and/or Internet technology. Minimal information was given regarding development or number of text messages used. The median effect size for the studies was 0.50. Conclusions: To date, using text messaging as a method to promote physical activity has only been studied by a small group of researchers. Current physical activity text messaging literature is characterized by small sample sizes, heterogeneous but positive effect sizes, and a lack of specificity as to the development of the text messages used in these studies. Further research in this area is imperative to facilitate the expansion of mobile technology to promote physical activity. © 2013 Sigma Theta Tau International.","Cell phone; Exercise; Intervention study; Mobile phone; Physical activity; Short message service; SMS; Text message","adult; evidence based nursing; fitness; health promotion; human; motor activity; procedures; text messaging; exercise; health promotion; intervention study; methodology; mobile phone; physical activity; review; short message service; SMS; text message; Adult; Evidence-Based Nursing; Health Promotion; Humans; Motor Activity; Physical Fitness; Text Messaging; cell phone; exercise; intervention study; mobile phone; physical activity; short message service; SMS; text message; Adult; Evidence-Based Nursing; Health Promotion; Humans; Motor Activity; Physical Fitness; Text Messaging","Buchholz, S.W.; Rush University College of Nursing, 600 South Paulina Street, Suite 1030D, Chicago, IL 60612-3832, United States; email: Susan_Buchholz@rush.edu",,,1545102X,,,"23746267","English","Worldviews Evid.-Based Nurs.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881103796

Several researchers have also been working on improving the scientific and methodological infrastructure to support SLRs in SE. We argue that there is also an apparent and essential need for evidence-based body of knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of SLRs in SE. Objective: The main objective of this research is to empirically investigate the adoption, value, and use of SLRs in SE research from various perspectives. Method: We used mixed-methods approach (systematically integrating tertiary literature review, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire-based survey) as it is based on a combination of complementary research methods which are expected to compensate each others' limitations. Results: A large majority of the participants are convinced of the value of using a rigourous and systematic methodology for literature reviews in SE research. However, there are concerns about the required time and resources for SLRs. One of the most important motivators for performing SLRs is new findings and inception of innovative ideas for further research. The reported SLRs are more influential compared to the traditional literature reviews in terms of number of citations. One of the main challenges of conducting SLRs is drawing a balance between methodological rigour and required effort. Conclusions: SLR has become a popular research methodology for conducting literature review and evidence aggregation in SE. There is an overall positive perception about this relatively new methodology to SE research. The findings provide interesting insights into different aspects of SLRs. We expect that the findings can provide valuable information to readers about what can be expected from conducting SLRs and the potential impact of such reviews. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, organizations heavily depend on their business-critical systems, which have been developed over long periods. These legacy applications are usually deployed on-premise. In recent years, research in cloud migration has been carried out. However, there is no secondary study to consolidate this research. Objective-This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically compare existing research on cloud migration. Method-We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) of 23 selected studies, published from 2010 to 2013. We classified and compared the selected studies based on a characterization framework that we also introduce in this paper. Results-The research synthesis results in a knowledge base of current solutions for legacy-to-cloud migration. This review also identifies research gaps and directions for future research. Conclusion-This review reveals that cloud migration research is still in early stages of maturity, but is advancing. It identifies the needs for a migration framework to help improving the maturity level and consequently trust into cloud migration. This review shows a lack of tool support to automate migration tasks. This study also identifies needs for architectural adaptation and self-adaptive cloud-enabled systems. © 2013 IEEE.","Cloud computing; cloud migration; legacy-to-cloud migration; systematic literature review","Cloud computing; Knowledge based systems; Cloud migrations; Critical systems; Legacy applications; Research synthesis; Software systems; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Distributed computer systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21687161,,,,"English","IEEE Trans.

Architectural decisions impact all subsequent phases in software development life cycle. Structure of large software systems has been in discussion since early 70s but software architecture started emerging as separate discipline since mid-90s. Objective: Researchers have been publishing empirical studies (i.e. case studies, experiments, experience reports) in SA discipline. Empirical literature has been aggregated in other disciplines of software engineering but no such effort has been made in SA. Objective of this study is to aggregate and synthesize the empirical evidence from literature of software architecture to report the trends, patterns and knowledge gaps. Method: To synthesize the empirical work in SA, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR). This study reports the results of SLR based on 247 included primary studies. Results: Based on the percentage of 247 primary studies we identified that SA Evaluation (28%), non- functional requirements related work (22%) and SA Design (12%) are relatively mature sub areas of SA. Most of the empirical work (59%) in SA uses case study research method. Experiments (20%) and experience reports (14%) are also employed in empirical SA work. Conclusion: SA discipline is maturing as few sub areas of SA are mature and some areas are new and being developed. We have also identified few emerging trends in SA i.e. service oriented architecture, Product line architecture, Aspect oriented architecture, and model driven architecture.

Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions. © 2013 IEEE.","Architecture-Centric Software Evolution; Evidence-Based and Empirical Study; Systematic Literature Review","Architecture-centric; Classification scheme; Empirical studies; Future research directions; Software Evolution; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Uncertain environments; Computer software maintenance; Reengineering; Research","Lero - The Irish Software Engineering Research Centre, School of Computing, Dublin City UniversityIreland",,,15345351,9780769549484,,,"English","Proc.

Three major design issues need to be considered while building software fault-tolerant architectures based on design diversity namely, selection and execution of variants and selection of an adjudication algorithm to determine the correct or adjudicated result from the variants. Each design issue, in turn, can be realized by a set of alternative design solutions, which present different degrees of quality requirements (e.g. memory consumption and reliability). Objective: To investigate whether existing approaches for fault-tolerant composite services support the above mentioned design issues and to provide a detailed classification of the analysed approaches. Method: A systematic literature review of diversity-based approaches for fault-tolerant composite services, which compose our primary studies. Results: We found 17 primary studies providing direct evidence about the research question. Our findings reveal that the primary studies support a wide variety of design decisions. For example, (i) variant services may be chosen at different points during the software lifecycle; (ii) both parallel and sequential execution schemes have been addressed; and (iii) a variety of adjudication mechanisms were found amongst the target papers. Conclusion: We build up a broad picture of what design issues have been addressed by existing diversity-based approaches for fault-tolerant composite services. Finally, practical issues and difficulties are summarized and directions for future work are suggested.

Objectives The overall aim of this work is to provide a body of knowledge for enabling successful KT in GSD settings. This is achieved by an in-depth understanding of KT challenges and mitigation strategies, both from the perspective of literature and industry. It also identifies the similarities and differences in challenges and strategies gathered from literature studies and industrial experts. Methods In order to fulfill the aim of the research, we collected data through a systematic literature review (SLR) and conducted interviews with industrial experts. Through the SLR we found 35 primary studies relevant to our objectives. We also conducted eight interviews of experienced industrial professionals from eight different multinational companies world-wide. For analyzing the data we used grounded theory and cross-case analysis. Results In total, 60 different challenges and 79 unique mitigation strategies are identified from both SLR and interview results. The challenges and mitigation strategies are grouped into three core categories of personnel, project and technology factors, thus giving rise to a conceptualization called as 2PT factors. There are greater numbers of challenges and mitigation strategies in the project and personnel factors, highlighting the complex interplay of project-related and human-intensive issues in GSD projects, while the technology factor plays the role as facilitator in transferring knowledge. The study also maps the mitigation strategies to challenges, which can guide practitioners in their selection of strategies to use for overcoming KT challenges in GSD. Conclusions We conclude that effective management of project and personnel factors, facilitated by technological factors, are crucial for a successful transfer of knowledge in GSD projects. Thus in future, the researchers and practitioners need to focus on the 2PT factors for ensuring effective KT in GSD settings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd","Global software development; Interviews; Knowledge transfer; Systematic literature review","Human resource management; Industrial research; Knowledge management; Software design; Global software development; Global software teams; In-depth understanding; Interviews; Knowledge transfer; Multi-national companies; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Planning","Afzal, W.; Department of Computer Sciences, Bahria UniversityPakistan; email: wasif.afzal@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",02684012,,IJMAE,,"English","Int J Inf Manage",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871359508

We collected and analyzed 1091 scholarly papers which were classified as being about ""e-government"" by the Web of Science database. The results indicate that hybrid method can be used to understand certain network-level structures and patterns in the EG domain which are beyond the scope of the predominantly-used systematic literature review (SLR) method. Particularly, the hybrid method is useful in understanding collaboration patterns between countries, institutions and regions in the EG domain, identifying key players by studying their network properties (i.e., degree centralities); and in understanding the pattern of relations among universities, industries, and government.

We comprehensively searched the peer-reviewed and grey literature. Two authors independently screened citations, extracted data and assessed study quality of included studies (any research design) focusing on mobile phone messaging interventions for HIV care. We present a narrative overview of the results. Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria: three randomized controlled trials, 11 interventional studies using other study designs and seven qualitative or cross-sectional studies. We also found six on-going trials and 21 projects. Five of the on-going trials and all the above mentioned projects took place in low or middle-income countries. Mobile phone messaging was researched for HIV prevention, appointment reminders, HIV testing reminders, medication adherence and for communication between health workers. Of the three randomized controlled trials assessing the use of short message service (SMS) to improve medication adherence, two showed positive results. Other interventional studies did not provide significant results. In conclusion, despite an extensive search we found limited evidence on the effectiveness of mobile phone messaging for HIV care.

Objectives: In this context, this paper aims to propose a business model to support automation of the systematic review method, contributing to the productivity and quality of the process. Method: Through the results of a previous review, we identified several contributions to the systematic review process. We define the process using the Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) and relate possible tool contributions to the proposed model. Results: The model and contributions proposed in this paper can be used to guide the development of computational tools to support SLR process and the proper execution of its methodology. Conclusions: The implementation of tools supporting SLR processes seems relevant to reduce effort and to ensure the quality of the application of the methodology.

Accordingly, evaluation of commercial Cloud services is necessary. However, the existing evaluation studies are relatively chaotic. There exists tremendous confusion and gap between practices and theory about Cloud services evaluation. Aim To facilitate relieving the aforementioned chaos, this work aims to synthesize the existing evaluation implementations to outline the state-of-the-practice and also identify research opportunities in Cloud services evaluation. Method Based on a conceptual evaluation model comprising six steps, the systematic literature review (SLR) method was employed to collect relevant evidence to investigate the Cloud services evaluation step by step. Results This SLR identified 82 relevant evaluation studies. The overall data collected from these studies essentially depicts the current practical landscape of implementing Cloud services evaluation, and in turn can be reused to facilitate future evaluation work. Conclusions Evaluation of commercial Cloud services has become a world-wide research topic. Some of the findings of this SLR identify several research gaps in the area of Cloud services evaluation (e.g.; Elasticity and Security evaluation of commercial Cloud services could be a long-term challenge), while some other findings suggest the trend of applying commercial Cloud services (e.g.; compared with PaaS, IaaS seems more suitable for customers and is particularly important in industry).

When the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies to be analysed, the process used to select studies can be arduous, specially when the selection review activity is performed and all studies under analysis are read more than once. An experiment was conducted as a pilot test to compare the performance and accuracy of graduate students in conducting the selection review activity manually and using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. This paper describes a replication study that used the same experimental design and materials of the original experiment. The results have confirmed the outcomes of the original experiment, i.e., VTM is promising and can improve the performance of the selection review of primary studies. There is a positive relationship between the use of VTM techniques and the time spent to conduct the selection review activity.

It is axiomatically believed to contribute significantly to a successful system. However, not much attention has been paid to ascertain in which phases of software development life cycle involvement or participation of users is most beneficial. In this paper we present an investigation into the concept of users' involvement during RE activities and explore its relationship with system success. We have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. Our SLR identified 87 empirical studies from the period of 1980 to 2012. Only 13 studies focused specifically on investigating users' involvement in RE and 9 of these confirmed benefits of involving users in requirements analysis and 4 remain inconclusive. Effective involvement of users in RE may reduce the need for their more active involvement in the rest of software development.

The process used to select primary studies can be arduous, particularly when the researcher faces large volumes of primary studies. Aim: An experiment was conducted as a pilot test to compare the performance and effectiveness of graduate students in selecting primary studies manually and using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. This paper describes a replication study. Method: The same experimental design and materials of the previous experiment were used in the current experiment. Result: The previous experiment revealed that VTM techniques can speed up the selection of primary studies and increase the number of studies correctly included/excluded (effectiveness). The results of the replication confirmed that studies are more rapidly selected using VTM. We observed that the level of experience in researching has a direct relationship with the effectiveness. Conclusion: VTM techniques have proven valuable in the selection of primary studies. © 2013 IEEE.","Controlled Experiment; Experimental Replication; Laboratory Package; Systematic Literature Review; Visual Text Mining","Data mining; Software engineering; Students; Controlled experiment; Experimental replications; Graduate students; Replication study; Study selection activities; Systematic literature review; Text mining; Visual text minings (VTM); Experiments",,,"IEEE Computer Society",,9780769551210,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Scholars are currently seeking publication outlets as critics debate whether this new leadership theory is significantly distinct, viable, and valuable for organizational success. The aim of this study was to identify empirical studies that explored servant leadership theory by engaging a sample population in order to assess and synthesize the mechanisms, outcomes, and impacts of servant leadership. Thus, we sought to provide an evidence-informed answer to how does servant leadership work, and how can we apply it? We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR), a methodology adopted from the medical sciences to synthesize research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner. A disciplined screening process resulted in a final sample population of 39 appropriate studies. The synthesis of these empirical studies revealed: (a) there is no consensus on the definition of servant leadership; (b) servant leadership theory is being investigated across a variety of contexts, cultures, and themes; (c) researchers are using multiple measures to explore servant leadership; and (d) servant leadership is a viable leadership theory that helps organizations and improves the well-being of followers. This study contributes to the development of servant leadership theory and practice. In addition, this study contributes to the methodology for conducting SLRs in the field of management, highlighting an effective method for mapping out thematically, and viewing holistically, new research topics.

As a starting point the paper presents a GSE model, designed to categorize solutions into process areas, useful for the analysis of the research community's contributions to state-of-the-art and identifying fundamental gaps in research. In addition, the model categorizing the solutions is populated with references and good-examples, useful for practitioners, which can use the model to find solutions to overall challenges in various process areas. The overall results of the systematic review revealed more than 330 papers containing 127 solutions that were then identified and mapped to the model.

Thus, the earlier they are detected, found and fixed, the lesser the maintenance costs. Several OO metrics have been proposed for assessing the quality of OO design and code and several empirical studies have been undertaken to validate the impact of OO metrics on fault proneness (FP). The question now is which metrics are useful in measuring the FP of OO classes? Consequently, we investigate the existing empirical validation of CK + SLOC metrics based on their state of significance, validation and usefulness. We used systematic literature review (SLR) methodology over a number of relevant article sources, and our results show the existence of 29 relevant empirical studies. Further analysis indicates that coupling, complexity and size measures have strong impact on FP of OO classes. Based on the results, we therefore conclude that these metrics can be used as good predictors for building quality fault models when that could assist in focusing resources on high risk components that are liable to cause system failures, when only CK + SLOC metrics are used. © 2013 World Scientific Publishing Company.","empirical; fault proneness; Metrics; object-oriented; systematic review; validation","Computer software reusability; Systems engineering; empirical; Fault proneness; Metrics; Object oriented; Systematic Review; validation; Object oriented programming",,,"World Scientific Publishing Co.

We aimed to conduct a systematic review of controlled trials of mobile technology interventions to improve health care delivery processes. Methods and Findings: We searched for all controlled trials of mobile technology based health interventions using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, UK NHS HTA (Jan 1990-Sept 2010). Two authors independently extracted data on allocation concealment, allocation sequence, blinding, completeness of follow-up, and measures of effect. We calculated effect estimates and we used random effects meta-analysis to give pooled estimates. We identified 42 trials. None of the trials had low risk of bias. Seven trials of health care provider support reported 25 outcomes regarding appropriate disease management, of which 11 showed statistically significant benefits. One trial reported a statistically significant improvement in nurse/surgeon communication using mobile phones. Two trials reported statistically significant reductions in correct diagnoses using mobile technology photos compared to gold standard. The pooled effect on appointment attendance using text message (short message service or SMS) reminders versus no reminder was increased, with a relative risk (RR) of 1.06 (95% CI 1.05-1.07, I2 = 6%). The pooled effects on the number of cancelled appointments was not significantly increased RR 1.08 (95% CI 0.89-1.30). There was no difference in attendance using SMS reminders versus other reminders (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.02, respectively). To address the limitation of the older search, we also reviewed more recent literature. Conclusions: The results for health care provider support interventions on diagnosis and management outcomes are generally consistent with modest benefits. Trials using mobile technology-based photos reported reductions in correct diagnoses when compared to the gold standard. SMS appointment reminders have modest benefits and may be appropriate for implementation. High quality trials measuring clinical outcomes are needed.

As our society relies more and more on the Web, the dependability of web applications has become increasingly important. To make these applications more dependable, for the past decade researchers have proposed various techniques for testing web-based software applications. Our literature search for related studies retrieved 147 papers in the area of web application testing, which have appeared between 2000 and 2011. Objective As this research area matures and the number of related papers increases, it is important to systematically identify, analyze, and classify the publications and provide an overview of the trends in this specialized field. Method We review and structure the body of knowledge related to web application testing through a systematic mapping (SM) study. As part of this study, we pose two sets of research questions, define selection and exclusion criteria, and systematically develop and refine a classification schema. In addition, we conduct a bibliometrics analysis of the papers included in our study. Results Our study includes a set of 79 papers (from the 147 retrieved papers) published in the area of web application testing between 2000 and 2011. We present the results of our systematic mapping study. Our mapping data is available through a publicly-accessible repository. We derive the observed trends, for instance, in terms of types of papers, sources of information to derive test cases, and types of evaluations used in papers. We also report the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain, including top-cited papers, active countries and researchers, and top venues in this research area. Conclusion We discuss the emerging trends in web application testing, and discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners in this area. The results of our systematic mapping can help researchers to obtain an overview of existing web application testing approaches and indentify areas in the field that require more attention from the research community. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In SSA, millions of people who never used traditional landlines now use mobile phones on a regular basis. Mobile health, or mHealth, is the utilization of short messaging service (SMS), wireless data transmission, voice calling, and smartphone applications to transmit health-related information or direct care. This systematic review analyzes and summarizes key articles from the current body of peer-reviewed literature on PubMed on the topic of mHealth in SSA. Studies included in the review demonstrate that mHealth can improve and reduce the cost of patient monitoring, medication adherence, and healthcare worker communication, especially in rural areas. mHealth has also shown initial promise in emergency and disaster response, helping standardize, store, analyze, and share patient information. Challenges for mHealth implementation in SSA include operating costs, knowledge, infrastructure, and policy among many others. Further studies of the effectiveness of mHealth interventions are being hindered by similar factors as well as a lack of standardization in study design. Overall, the current evidence is not strong enough to warrant large-scale implementation of existing mHealth interventions in SSA, but rapid progress of both infrastructure and mHealth-related research in the region could justify scale-up of the most promising programs in the near future. © 2013 Thomas J.

Yet, not all causes of non-adherence are dependent on the patient. Having to pay for medication reduces adherence rates. Non- adherence has severe public health implications which must be addressed locally and globally. This paper seeks to describe the trends in adherence rates reported in Cameroon and to investigate the determinants of adherence to ART in the Cameroon Mobile Phone SMS (CAMPS) trial.Methods: We conducted a systematic review of electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, CINAHL, EMBASE and PSYCINFO) for publications on adherence to ART in Cameroon (from January 1999 to May 2012) and described the trend in reported adherence rates and the factors associated with adherence. Data were extracted in duplicate. We used multivariable analyses on the baseline data for 200 participants in the CAMPS trial to determine the factors associated with adherence in four models using different measures of adherence (more than 90% or 95% on the visual analogue scale, no missed doses and a composite measure: 100% on the visual analogue scale, no missed doses and all pills taken on time).Results: We identified nine studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Adherence to ART in Cameroon has risen steadily between 2000 and 2010, corresponding to reductions in the cost of medication. The factors associated with adherence to ART in Cameroon are grouped into patient, medication and disease related factors. We also identified factors related to the health system and the patient-provider relationship. In the CAMPS trial, education, side effects experienced and number of reminder methods were found to improve adherence, but only using multiple reminder methods was associated with better adherence in all the regression models (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 4.11, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.89, 8.93; p<0.001; model IV).Conclusions: Reducing the cost of ART is an important aspect of ensuring adequate adherence rates. Using multiple reminder methods may have a cumulative effect on adherence to ART, but should be investigated further. © 2012 Mbuagbaw et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Adherence; Antiretroviral therapy; Cameroon; CAMPS; Reminder methods","antivirus agent; article; Cameroon; Cinahl; drug cost; drug safety; Embase; health education; highly active antiretroviral therapy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Internet; medical literature; Medline; mobile phone; patient compliance; pill; priority journal; PsycINFO; systematic review; visual analog scale","Mbuagbaw, L.; Centre for Development of Best Practices in Health (CDBPH), Yaoundé Central Hospital, Avenue Henri Dunant, Messa, Po Box 87, Yaoundé, Cameroon; email: mbuagblc@mcmaster.ca",,,17426405,,,,"English","AIDS Res.

We used the systematic review method to identify SLRs (Systematic Literature Reviews) that address DSD aspects. This study is categorized as a tertiary review. Of fourteen SLRs, seven address aspects of managing distributed development. Four SLRs addressed topics of engineering process. The three remaining are related to Requirements, Design and Software Engineering Education in DSD. The topic areas covered by SLRs are limited, where the majority are focused on summarize the current knowledge concerning a research question.

Regression testing is primarily a maintenance activity. The main motivation behind this systematic review is to provide a ground for advancement of research in the field of Regression Test Prioritization. The existing techniques were compared along with their collected empirical evidences to find if any particular approach was superior to others. 65 papers reporting 50 experiments and 15 case studies were identified. A total of 106 techniques were evaluated for regression test prioritization. Also, a rigorous analysis of the techniques was performed by comparing them in terms of various measures like size of study, type of study, approach, input method, tool, metrics etc. Encouragingly, SLR yielded that almost half of the techniques for regression test prioritization are independent of their implementation language. While on the other hand the future research should focus on bridging the large gaps that were found existing in the usage of various tools and artifacts. During the course of research, preliminary literature survey indicated that to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review has been published so far on the topic of regression test prioritization.","Regression testing; Systematic literature review (SLR); Test Prioritization","Empirical evidence; Implementation languages; Input methods; Literature survey; Maintenance activity; Modified software; Prioritization; Regression testing; Regression tests; Rigorous analysis; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Regression analysis; Research; Software testing; Testing","Singh, Y.; Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda, Gujarat, India; email: ys66@rediffmail.com",,,03505596,,INFOF,,"English","Informatica",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871854736

We illustrate the model-driven approach to SLRs via an example focused on the use of BPMN (Business Process Modelling Notation) in organizations. We discuss in detail the process followed in using the model-driven SLR method, and show how it is based on a hermeneutic cycle of reading and interpreting, in order to develop and refine a model which synthesizes the research findings of previous qualitative studies. This study can serve as an exemplar for other researchers wishing to carry out model-driven SLRs.

The aim of the study was to assess the state of the art of the use of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals for palliation therapy of pain from bone metastases. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted about therapy with 89Sr-chloride and 153Sm-EDTMP between 2001-2011. The primary outcomes were efficacy and toxicity. Descriptive and quantitative data were extracted from each study, calculating event rates and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pooled analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed. Results. Fifty-seven studies contributed to the systematic review. Forty-six studies used radiopharmaceuticals as a single agent, 15 investigated therapeutic combinations. Most of the studies included patients with prostate cancer. The overall efficacy of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals as single agents was 70%, whereas it was 74% when used in combination with other therapies. Complete response was reported in 27% of patients. Efficacy resulted to be 70% for prostate cancer and 79% for breast cancer. The overall toxicity of radiopharmaceuticals was 15%: the toxicity was 11% selecting only studies reporting on the use of radiopharmaceuticals as a single agent. No significant difference was found between bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals and other oncological treatments regarding efficacy or toxicity. Reports of objective response outcomes suggest that bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals have some cytotoxic activity, either alone or combination with chemotherapy. Conclusion. This literature analysis emphasizes multiple evidences of high efficacy and low toxicity of bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals; moreover, this therapy may have a therapeutic potential beyond simple palliation of bone pain.","Painful bone metastasis; Palliative care; Radiopharmaceuticals","bisphosphonic acid derivative; docetaxel; doxorubicin; lexidronam samarium sm 153; radiopharmaceutical agent; strontium 89; strontium chloride; bone metastasis; bone pain; breast cancer; cancer palliative therapy; conference paper; confidence interval; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; Embase; external beam radiotherapy; human; Medline; meta analysis; outcome assessment; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk; systematic review; Bone Neoplasms; Comorbidity; Humans; Pain; Palliative Care; Radiation Injuries; Radiopharmaceuticals; Risk Factors; Samarium; Strontium Radioisotopes; Treatment Outcome","D'Angelo, G.; Nuclear Medicine, Catholic University, Largo F.

They have several well-known disadvantages (e.g., inflexible, domain unspecific, and hard to maintain), and this is recognized by both vendors and customers of these software systems. Both vendors and customers of these systems are well aware that better and more flexible customer specific solutions can be created following the service-oriented paradigm. Hence, momentum is growing within enterprises to evolve legacy systems towards Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The evolution to SOA is favored because of various advantages including well established sets of open standards, platform and language independent interfaces, clear separation of service interface and implementation, and loose-coupling among services. In the last decade, there have been significant developments in legacy to SOA evolution, and that has resulted in a large research body of which there exists no comprehensive overview. This chapter provides a historic overview, focusing on the methods and techniques used in legacy to SOA evolution. The authors conducted a systematic literature review to collect legacy to SOA evolution approaches reported from 2000 to August 2011. To this end, 121 primary studies were found and evaluated using an evaluation framework, which was developed from three evolution and modernization methods widely used in the software re-engineering domain. The evaluation constitutes the inventory of current research approaches and methods and techniques used in legacy to SOA evolution. The result of the SLR also identifies current research issues in legacy to SOA evolution and provides future research directions to address those research issues. © 2013, IGI Global.",,,"Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht UniversityNetherlands",,"IGI Global",,9781466624887,,,"English","Migrating Legacy Applic.: Challenges in Serv.

However, concern exists regarding its possible association with infectious complications including varicella zoster virus (VZV) and herpes zoster (HZ). Furthermore, no consensus exists regarding pre-MTX VZV screening or the use of VZV vaccine. Methods: We undertook systematic literature review (SLR) investigating the relationship between the use of MTX in patients with RA and VZV and HZ infection. Additionally, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, HPA, the CDC, Rheumatology societies and WHO web sites and publications were consulted. Results: Thirty-five studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria comprising 29 observational studies and 6 case reports. The case reports and 13 observation studies considered the association between MTX and HZ. Three of the observational studies reported a positive association although in 5 cases, patients were concurrently treated with prednisolone. Five studies concluded that there was no association between HZ and MTX. Three studies comparing the infection rates of MTX with other RA therapies found that MTX did not result in higher HZ infection rates. Three studies examining the association between HZ and MTX treatment duration failed to show a link. Conclusion: No evidence exists to support an association between MTX and VZV infection in RA patients and the data regarding the role of MTX in HZ development is conflicting. The role of pre-MTX VZV screening is controversial and, as it may delay initiation of RA treatment, we suggest against VZV screening in this context. © Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2012.","Chickenpox; Herpes zoster; Methotrexate; Rheumatoid arthritis; Shingles; Vaccination; Varicella zoster","azathioprine; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; leflunomide; methotrexate; prednisolone; recombinant interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; antirheumatic agent; methotrexate; clinical trial (topic); drug efficacy; drug potentiation; herpes zoster; human; infection rate; infection risk; low drug dose; practice guideline; priority journal; review; rheumatoid arthritis; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review; treatment duration; treatment response; adult; aged; chemically induced disorder; chickenpox; herpes zoster; middle aged; virology; Adult; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Chickenpox; Herpes Zoster; Humans; Methotrexate; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors","Nisar, M.K.; Rheumatology Research Unit, Addenbrooke's Hospital, CUHNHSFT, Box 194, Cambridge CB2 2QQ, United Kingdom; email: drnisar12@yahoo.co.uk",,,0392856X,,CERHD,"23044005","English","Clin.

Major goal of this study was assessment of the relation and integration of ASD and OSSD. Analyzing of collected data shows that ASD and OSSD are able to support each other. Some practices in one of them are useful in the other.

The purpose of this paper is to identify important strategic changes in the field and to outline future requirements and research opportunities in SCRM. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology employed by this research was used to evaluate and categorise a literature survey of quality articles published over a period of ten years (2000-2010). Additionally, the findings from the SLR have been strengthened through cross validation against results obtained from an associated text mining activity. The SLR methodology has provided a rich, unbiased and holistic picture of the advances in the field of SCRM. Consequently, important new research areas have been identified based on a multi-perspective descriptive and thematic data analysis. In addition, the analysis, based on evolved typologies, indicates a growth of SCRM from a nascent to a fairly established activity over the past decade. The systematic approach undertaken for the literature review will provide future researchers and managers with an insightful understanding of the scope of the SCRM field. Also, the literature review provides important clues on new research directions for SCRM through identification of gaps in current knowledge. The holistic approach to SCRM was found to be an important missing link in earlier literature surveys. The outcome of the SLR reported in this paper has provided critical insights into the present and future scope of the SCRM field. The identified research insights, gaps and future directions will encourage new research techniques, with a view to managing the risks in the globalized supply chain environment. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Risk management; Supply chain management; Supply chain risk management; Systematic literature review; Text mining",,,,,09574093,,,,"English","Int.

Design: Two systematic reviews were conducted of published studies (meta-analysis, Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs), Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs), cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies). Electronic databases were searched for articles that assessed the effect of infant pacifier use on the risk of SIDS and/or on breastfeeding outcomes. Retrieved articles were assessed for validity and quality using the Dietitians Association of Australia (DAA) Quality Criteria Checklist and the NHMRC Evidence Hierarchy before being included in the review. Results: The initial search of the databases resulted in 68 references on the use of pacifiers and SIDS; three articles (1 meta-analysis, 1 SLR, 1 narrative review) received a positive rating according to the DAA checklist. The three publications consistently found pacifier use at last sleep was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of SIDS and to a lesser extent, routine pacifier use also provided a significant reduction in the risk. Searching the electronic databases for use of pacifiers and breastfeeding duration resulted in 188 publications and four of these publications were retrieved for analysis (1 Cochrane review, 1 SLR, 1 meta-analysis, 1 cohort study). The epidemiological evidence found pacifier use reduced the duration of any, full and exclusive breastfeeding, but this effect was not significant in four out of the five RCTs analysed in the Cochrane review and the SLR. Conclusion: The present review provides evidence of the association between pacifier use during the postnatal period and a decreased risk of SIDS whilst also drawing attention to the negative association between early pacifier use and reduced duration of breastfeeding (any, full and exclusive). This is the first review to emphasise the U-shaped effect of pacifiers on infant health. When assessing the totality of the evidence the results indicate that pacifiers should be advised against in the first month of life, but after the first month pacifier use may reduce the probability of SIDS. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.","Breastfeeding; Infant; Pacifier; SIDS; Sudden infant death syndrome; Systematic literature review","breast feeding; data base; health hazard; human; infant welfare; meta analysis; pacifier; parent; priority journal; review; sleep; sudden infant death syndrome; systematic review","Hewitt, K.; Accredited Practising Dietitian, School of Public Health, Curtin University, GPO Box U1987, Perth, WA 6845, Australia; email: k.hewitt@curtin.edu.au",,,15733963,,,,"English","Curr.

Although considerable research effort has been made in this area, no agreement has been reached on the influence of dispersion on team coordination and performance. The objective of this paper is to summarize the evidence on the relationship among context dispersion, team coordination and performance in global software projects. We have performed a Systematic literature review (SLR) to collect relevant studies and a thematic analysis to synthesize the extracted data. We found 28 primary studies reporting the impact of five dispersion dimensions on team performance. Previously, only two primary studies considered and distinguished all of these dispersion dimensions in studying dispersed team performance. The dispersion dimensions affect team outcomes indirectly through influencing organic and mechanistic coordination processes. Empirical evidence show that geographical dispersion impacts negatively and temporal dispersion has a mixed effect on team performance. While studies with teams working across different time zones shows a tendency that the team performance is pessimistically perceived, studies that use direct measure on task performance shows a positive association to temporal dispersion. The paper provides implications for future research and practitioners in establishing effective distributed team coordination.

Thus, those with LBP frequently turn to treatments such as spinal manipulation (SM). Many clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy or effectiveness of SM for LBP. The primary objective of this paper was to describe the current literature on patient-centered outcomes following a specific type of commonly used SM, high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA), in patients with LBP. A systematic search strategy was used to capture all LBP clinical trials of HVLA using our predefined patient-centered outcomes: visual analogue scale, numerical pain rating scale, Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire, and the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index. Of the 1294 articles identified by our search, 38 met our eligibility criteria. Like previous SM for LBP systematic reviews, this review shows a small but consistent treatment effect at least as large as that seen in other conservative methods of care. The heterogeneity and inconsistency in reporting within the studies reviewed makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Future SM studies for LBP would benefit if some of these issues were addressed by the scientific community before further research in this area is conducted. © 2012.","Low back pain; Patient-centered outcomes; Spinal manipulation","acupuncture; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; diathermy; disease severity; human; instrument validation; intermethod comparison; kinesiotherapy; low back pain; major clinical study; manipulative medicine; massage; medical care; Oswestry Disability Index; outcome assessment; pain assessment; physiotherapy; priority journal; questionnaire; review; Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire; stretching exercise; systematic review; transcutaneous nerve stimulation; treatment duration; visual analog scale; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain; Male; Manipulation, Spinal; Pain Measurement; Patient Satisfaction; Patient-Centered Care; Prevalence; Treatment Outcome","Goertz, C.M.741 Brady St., Davenport, IA 52803, United States; email: christine.goertz@palmer.edu",,,10506411,,JEKIE,"22534288","English","J.

Case studies illustrate the details of applying it for supporting SLR steps. [Results]: Results show that through using COSONT, we acquire the same conclusion compared with sheer manual works, but the efforts involved is significantly reduced.

Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.","distributed development; global software development; mapping study; systematic review; tertiary review","Automated searches; Development process; Distributed development; Global software development; Global software engineering; Ireland; Mapping studies; Project execution; Project planning and control; Research groups; Risk factors; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Tertiary study; Publishing; Software design; Research","Verner, J.M.; Keele University, Staffordshire ST5 5BG, United Kingdom",,,,9781849195416,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865513218

The great proliferation of maturity models leads to a need for systematic approaches to build them. Aim: To discover and analyze the existing methods and recommended practices for developing maturity models. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted. Results: 1500 papers were returned as a result of the searches, from which 23 were chosen as candidates, and 7 of these, published between 2005 and 2010, were eventually selected as primary studies. Conclusions: The proposal of methods for maturity models development is an emerging topic in literature. Most published maturity models are based on practices and success factors from projects that showed good results in an organization or industry, but which lack a sound theoretical basis and methodology. The proposed methods highlight as main activities: to establish goals for maturity model development, to design model architecture, to set out capability levels and dimensions, to and pilot testing. However, the creation of an assessment questionnaire and specific activities for maintenance are poorly supported. The SLR results have served to propose a method for developing maturity models that is focused on product quality characteristics.","development method; maturity model; software process improvement","Design models; Development method; Emerging topics; Engineering community; ISO/IEC 15504; Maturity model; Pilot testing; Product quality; Recommended practice; Software Process Improvement; Software Quality; Specific activity; Success factors; Systematic literature review; Theoretical basis; Computer software selection and evaluation; Standards; Software engineering","García-Mireles, G.A.; Departmento de Matemáticas, Universidad de Sonora, Blvd. Encinas y Rosales s/n col.

We assessed the 100 first results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classified publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unfitting usage of terms within the search query.

Our previous studies have assessed these using the subjective opinions of researchers. Objective: In order to provide a more objective assessment of value, for this study, we used the results of a systematic mapping study to investigate how well mapping studies identify clusters of related studies and to what extent such clusters are complete. Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.","completeness; component; regression testing; software engineering mapping studies; unit testing","completeness; component; Mapping studies; Regression testing; Unit testing; Research; Software engineering; Software testing; Mapping","Kitchenham, B.; School of Computing and Mathematics, Keele University, Keele, Staffordshire, ST5 5BG, United Kingdom; email: b.a.kitchenham@cs.keele.ac.uk",,,,9781849195416,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865525612

A process description is important for coordinating all the software development activities involving both people and technology. Aim: The research question that this study sets out to answer is: What activities do open source software process models contain? The activity groups on which it focuses are Concept Exploration, Software Requirements, Design, Maintenance and Evaluation. Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS). A SMS is a form of systematic literature review that aims to identify and classify available research papers concerning a particular issue. Results: We located a total of 29 primary studies, which we categorized by the open source software project that they examine and by activity types (Concept Exploration, Software Requirements, Design, Maintenance and Evaluation). The activities present in most of the open source software development processes were Execute Tests and Conduct Reviews, which belong to the Evaluation activities group. Maintenance is the only group that has primary studies addressing all the activities that it contains. Conclusions: The primary studies located by the SMS are the starting point for analyzing the open source software development process and proposing a process model for this community. The papers in our paper pool that describe a specific open source software project provide more regarding our research question than the papers that talk about open source software development without referring to a specific open source software project.","open source software development; software engineering; systematic mapping study","Development activity; Evaluation activity; Open Source Software; Open source software development; Open source software projects; Process model; Research papers; Research questions; Software requirements; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Maintenance; Mapping; Paper; Requirements engineering; Research; Software design; Software engineering; Computer software","Acuña, S.T.; Departamento de Ingeniería Informática, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Calle Francisco Tomás y Valiente 11, 28049 Madrid, Spain; email: silvia.acunna@uam.es",,,,9781849195416,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865517266

Although patients' reasons for not being adherent are diverse, one of the most commonly reported barriers is forgetfulness. Reminding patients to take their medication may provide a solution. Electronic reminders (automatically sent reminders without personal contact between the healthcare provider and patient) are now increasingly being used in the effort to improve adherence. Objective To examine the effectiveness of interventions using electronic reminders in improving patients' adherence to chronic medication. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Electronic searches were supplemented by manual searching of reference lists and reviews. Two reviewers independently screened all citations. Full text was obtained from selected citations and screened for final inclusion. The methodological quality of studies was assessed. Results Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Four studies evaluated short message service (SMS) reminders, seven audiovisual reminders from electronic reminder devices (ERD), and two pager messages. Best evidence synthesis revealed evidence for the effectiveness of electronic reminders, provided by eight (four high, four low quality) studies showing significant effects on patients' adherence, seven of which measured short-term effects (follow-up period <6 months). Improved adherence was found in all but one study using SMS reminders, four studies using ERD and one pager intervention. In addition, one high quality study using an ERD found subgroup effects. Conclusion This review provides evidence for the shortterm effectiveness of electronic reminders, especially SMS reminders.

To address these limitations the paper reports on the conception and development of an integrated modelling methodology designed to underpin the analytical design of complex supply chains. The methodology is based upon a systematic deployment of EM, CLD, and SM techniques; the integration of which is achieved via common modelling concepts and decomposition principles. Thereby the methodology facilitates: (i) graphical representation and description of key processing, resourcing and work flow properties of supply chain configurations; (ii) behavioural exploration of currently configured supply chains, to facilitate reasoning about uncertain demand impacts on supply, make, delivery, and return processes; (iii) predictive quantification about relative performances of alternative complex supply chain configurations, including risk assessments. Guidelines for the application of each step of the methodology are described. Also described are recommended data collection methods and expected modelling outcomes for each step. The methodology is being extensively case tested to quantify potential benefits costs relative to current best industry practice. The paper reflects on preliminary benefits gained during industry based case study modelling and identifies areas of potential improvement.

Alternative modes of communication of results include face-to-face communication, postal messages, calls to landlines or mobile phones, through web-based health records and email. Possible advantages of mobile phone messaging include convenience to both patients and healthcare providers, reduced waiting times for health services and healthcare costs. Objectives: To assess the effects of mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical investigations, on people's healthcare-seeking behaviour and health outcomes. Secondary objectives include assessment of participants' evaluation of the intervention, direct and indirect healthcare costs and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009). We also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We included studies assessing mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical tests, between a healthcare provider or 'treatment buddy' and patient. We only included studies in which it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest were health outcomes and healthcare utilisation as a result of the intervention. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, costs and potential harms or adverse effects of the intervention. Main results: We included one randomised controlled trial involving 2782 participants. The study investigated the effects of mobile phone messaging in alleviating anxiety in women waiting for prenatal biochemical screening results for Down syndrome, by providing fast reporting of results before a follow-up appointment. The study measured health outcomes using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which includes a scale (20 to 80 points, higher score indicates higher anxiety) to describe how the respondent feels at a particular moment in time (state anxiety). The study, which was at high risk of bias, found that women who had received their test result early by text message had a mean anxiety score 2.48 points lower than women who had not yet received their result (95% CI - 8.79 to 3.84). Women with a serum-negative test result receiving their result early had a mean anxiety score 5.3 points lower (95% CI - 5.99 to -4.61) than women in the control group. Women with a serum-positive test result receiving their result early by text message had a mean anxiety score 1.2 points higher (95% CI - 3.48 to 5.88) than women in the control group.The evidence was of low quality due to high risk of bias in the included study, and the fact that the evidence comes from one study only. The study did not report on other outcomes of interest, such as patient satisfaction, adverse events or cost. Authors' conclusions: We found very limited evidence of low quality that communicating results of medical investigations by mobile phone messaging may make little or no difference to women's anxiety overall or in women with positive test results, but may reduce anxiety in women with negative test results. However, with only one study included in this review, this evidence is insufficient to inform recommendations at this time. More research is needed on the effectiveness and user evaluation of these interventions. In particular, more research should be conducted into the potential risks and limitations of these interventions. © 2012 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Promoting positive behavior change is an ongoing challenge that warrants innovative solutions. Mobile phone use is becoming widespread across populations and merits further exploration as a strategy to promote wellness and reduce health disparities. Aims: The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence using text messaging as a tool to deliver healthy lifestyle behavior intervention programs in pediatric and adolescent populations. The following question was used to guide the systematic review, ""In pediatric and adolescent populations, how does the use of text-message-based interventions versus control or comparison interventions affect healthy lifestyle behaviors?"" Methods: A systematic search for relevant literature was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, and by hand-searching bibliographies. Evidence was compiled from experimental studies in peer-reviewed journals published from 2004 to May 15, 2011. Data were extracted using guidelines set forth by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination. Results: Thirty-seven articles were identified from the comprehensive search. Eight articles representing seven studies (two articles were published describing different aspects of the outcomes from one study) met inclusion for this review. Mean age of participants in the study ranged from 8.7 to 17.9 years of age. Differences between groups on healthy lifestyle behaviors were significant in five studies. Conclusions: This review supports previous literature suggesting that mobile phones are uniquely positioned to bridge gaps in health disparities and reach across demographics. Interventions using short messaging service may be most effective as a reminder system to support disease management behaviors. Existing recommendations for tailored, interactive, and family-centered care are supported with mobile technology recommended to augment clinical practice and health behavior change efforts. However, more rigorous, theory-based intervention research using mobile technology is warranted in pediatric and adolescent populations. © 2012 Sigma Theta Tau International.","Adolescent; Behavior change; Cellular phone; Health promotion; Healthy lifestyles; Mobile phone; Pediatric; SMS; Text messaging","adolescent; child; health behavior; health promotion; human; intervention study; lifestyle; methodology; review; text messaging; Adolescent; Child; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Intervention Studies; Life Style; Text Messaging","Militello, L.K.; Arizona State University, College of Nursing and Health Innovation, 500 North 3rd Street, Phoenix, AZ 85004, United States; email: lisa.militello@asu.edu",,,1545102X,,,"22268959","English","Worldviews Evid.-Based Nurs.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860236862

The effect on bone pain in other cancer types, including breast cancer, remains unclear. The purpose of the study was to perform a systematic review of the use of radioisotopes for pain relief in metastatic breast cancer. A literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science (1970 to September 2009) for clinical studies with a primary outcome of pain, performance status, or quality of life. Eligibility criteria were the following: (1) the trial must include at least 10 breast cancer patients with painful bone metastasis, (2) the radionuclide has been approved by regulatory authorities in Europe or the United States and is commercially available (Sr-89, Sm-153, and Re-186), (3) the dose of radionuclides must be clinically effective, (4) the primary endpoint must be pain, performance status or quality of life, and (5) separate reporting of efficacy should be available for breast cancer patients provided the trial included patients with various types of cancer. The literature search identified 189 individual studies of which 19 trials fulfilled the eligibility criteria. There were three randomized controlled trials of which two trials compared two different radionuclides, and one trial compared two doses of Sm-153. In addition, there were 16 uncontrolled trials. Reporting of trial research methodology in the randomized as well as the uncontrolled trials was low (median Jadad score of 1, range 1-2). Key trial details, such as patient recruitment, description of prior palliative therapies, baseline characteristics, follow up, and reporting of outcome was insufficient in a large proportion of the trials. According to Center of Evidence-based Medicine criteria, there is level 4 documentation for the effect of radionuclides in painful bone metastasis in breast cancer. It has been concluded that there is limited clinical evidence supporting the clinical effect of radionuclides in relieving pain from bone metastasis in breast cancer. Large, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the utility of bone-seeking radionuclides in the palliative care of breast cancer patients. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Bone metastasis; Breast cancer; Pain; Radionuclides; Rhenium-186; Samarium-153; Strontium-89","nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; radioisotope; rhenium 186; samarium 153; strontium 89; blood toxicity; bone metastasis; bone pain; breast metastasis; cancer pain; cancer patient; clinical effectiveness; disease severity; human; leukopenia; quality of life; radioisotope therapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; systematic review; thrombocytopenia; Bone Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Radioisotopes; Radiopharmaceuticals","Petersen, L.J.; Department of Clinical Physiology, Viborg Hospital, Heiberg Alle 4, DK-8800 Viborg, Denmark; email: lars.j.petersen@viborg.rm.dk",,,03057372,,CTRED,"21683530","English","Cancer Treat.

Important decisions need to be made at several points in the review process, relating to search of the literature, selection of relevant primary studies and use of methods of synthesis. Visualization can support tasks that involve large collections of data, such as the studies collected, evaluated and summarized in an SLR. The objective of this paper is to present the results of a systematic mapping study (SM) conducted to collect and evaluate evidence on the use of a specific visualization technique, visual data mining (VDM), to support the SLR process. We reviewed 20 papers and our results indicate a scarcity of research on the use of VDM to help with conducting SLRs in the software engineering domain. However, most of the studies (16 of the 20 studies included in our mapping) have been conducted in the field of medicine and they revealed that the activities of data extraction and data synthesis, related to conducting the review phase of an SLR process, have more VDM support than other activities. In contrast, according to our SM, previous studies using VDM techniques with SLRs have not employed such techniques during the SLR's planning and reporting phases.© 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Visual data mining","Data extraction; Data synthesis; Methods of synthesis; Research questions; Review process; Software engineering domain; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Visual data mining; Visualization technique; Data mining; Software engineering; Visualization; Mapping","Felizardo, K.

Methods: A systematic literature review (SLR) of available treatments for PsA was performed using the largest electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE) by two working groups formed within the EULAR taskforce. This comprised a comprehensive sample of rheumatologists, dermatologists, epidemiologists and patients. The available evidence was reviewed for NSAIDs, synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), local and systemic corticosteroids and biologic drugs. All articles and abstracts published between 1962 and January 2010 were reviewed and considered and a meta-analysis of data on biological therapies was performed. Results: While little data are available on NSAIDs, glucocorticoids and synthetic DMARDs, the available evidence suggests an acceptable efficacy and safety profile of both NSAIDs and synthetic DMARDs (methotrexate, cyclosporine A, sulfasalazine and leflunomide) in PsA. More evidence is available (level 1B) supporting the efficacy of anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents (adalimumab, etanercept, golimumab and infliximab) in treating the signs and symptoms of PsA as well as reducing radiographic progression. Registry data show no new safety concerns, although the numbers studied to date are relatively small. Conclusions: This SLR reveals some evidence to support the use of NSAIDs and synthetic DMARDs and good evidence for the efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in PsA.",,"adalimumab; alefacept; antipsoriasis agent; auranofin; azathioprine; celecoxib; chloroquine; colchicine; corticosteroid; cyclosporin A; efalizumab; etanercept; fumaric acid; glucocorticoid; gold salt; golimumab; infliximab; leflunomide; methotrexate; nimesulide; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; penicillamine; placebo; salazosulfapyridine; ustekinumab; clinical feature; disease course; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug safety; human; joint radiography; loading drug dose; meta analysis; monotherapy; practice guideline; priority journal; psoriatic arthritis; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; symptom; systematic review; treatment duration; treatment response; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Biological Agents; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Marzo-Ortega, H.; Section of Musculoskeletal Disease, Chapel Allerton Hospital, Chapeltown Road, Leeds LS7 4SA, United Kingdom; email: medhmo@leeds.ac.uk",,,00034967,,ARDIA,"21803753","English","Ann.

Despite its relevance, most of the process is conducted manually, implying additional effort when the Selection Review task is performed and leading to reading all studies under analysis more than once. Objective: We propose an approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques to assist the Selection Review task in SLR. It is implemented into a VTM tool (Revis), which is freely available for use. Method: We have selected and implemented appropriate visualization techniques into our approach and validated and demonstrated its usefulness in performing real SLRs. Results: The results have shown that employment of VTM techniques can successfully assist in the Selection Review task, speeding up the entire SLR process in comparison to the conventional approach. Conclusion: VTM techniques are valuable tools to be used in the context of selecting studies in the SLR process, prone to speed up some stages of SLRs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The lack of formal SM in projects and the weaknesses of the qualitative methods of SM are two important issues that are reported in the literature. The paper presents a critical review of the existing literature, addresses stakeholder notion, and related issues within two different schools of thoughts. It proposes to advocate that the management of stakeholders should improve its position to a formal process, and plays a role that is more accountable and align with the project execution. This paper aims to contribute to SM research by comparing the existing SM frameworks, and suggests what should be developed to improve it in projects. The research proposal is based on the researchers' experience, which is supported by the literature feedback to answer the question relating to what are the features of an effective SM in projects.

The ubiquity of mobile phones, which allow for short message service (SMS), provides new and innovative opportunities for disease prevention efforts. Objective: The aim of this review was to describe the characteristics and outcomes of SMS interventions for disease prevention in developing countries and provide recommendations for future work. Methods: A systematic search of peer-reviewed and gray literature was performed for papers published in English, French, and German before May 2011 that describe SMS applications for disease prevention in developing countries. Results: A total of 34 SMS applications were described, among which 5 had findings of an evaluation reported. The majority of SMS applications were pilot projects in various levels of sophistication; nearly all came from gray literature sources. Many applications were initiated by the project with modes of intervention varying between one-way or two-way communication, with or without incentives, and with educative games. Evaluated interventions were well accepted by the beneficiaries. The primary barriers identified were language, timing of messages, mobile network fluctuations, lack of financial incentives, data privacy, and mobile phone turnover. Conclusion: This review illustrates that while many SMS applications for disease prevention exist, few have been evaluated. The dearth of peer-reviewed studies and the limited evidence found in this systematic review highlight the need for high-quality efficacy studies examining behavioral, social, and economic outcomes of SMS applications and mobile phone interventions aimed to promote health in developing country contexts.","Developing countries; Mobile health; Prevention; Short message service; SMS","developing country; human; patient attitude; preventive medicine; review; text messaging; Developing Countries; Humans; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Preventive Medicine; Text Messaging","Dèglise, C.; Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Socinstrasse 57, Basel, 4002, Switzerland; email: cardeglise@yahoo.com",,,14388871,,,"22262730","English","J.

Materials and Methods: A systematic literature search was performed to identify the articles as to SLE with SS between 1970 and May 2011. The demographics, pertinent clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from 6 publications, and a meta-analysis was performed. The pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence interval were computed for the variability of these parameters between SLE-SS and SLE. Results: A total of 6 studies were included, consisting of 2489 patients with SLE and 444 with SLE-SS, and the estimated prevalence of the latter was 17.8%. Patients with SLE-SS were older and more often had associated oral ulcers and arthritis. In contrast, proteinuria (odds ratio = 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.25; P < 0.0001) was more common in SLE alone than SLE-SS, and central nervous system involvement tended to be more common. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies were equally prevalent in both groups. Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies were more frequent, and anti-Sm and anti-cardiolipin antibodies were less prevalent in SLE-SS than SLE alone. Conclusions: There are significant variances in certain clinical and laboratory aspects between SLE-SS and SLE. This combined disease of SLE-SS has distinct features with relatively less major internal organ involvement but has more specific autoantibody profile and favorable clinical outcome.

Both the palpebral and the bulbar ocular conjunctival surfaces are usually affected and typically become red and inflamed. Antibiotic therapy is widely used for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999; updated in 2006 and again in 2012. To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 18 July 2012. We included double-masked randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic treatments. Two authors (UN and SM) independently checked and reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies. We graded the included RCTs for methodological quality using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardised manner. We performed random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan. We identified 11 eligible RCTs which randomised a total of 3673 participants. One further trial, which was published in abstract form in 1990 but has yet to be reported fully, is currently 'awaiting assessment'. Six of the 11 included studies have been included for the first time in this latest (2012) update. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. We judged two of the trials to be of high quality and graded the remainder as poor quality.Meta-analyses of data on clinical and microbiological remission rates revealed that topical antibiotics were of benefit in improving 'early' (days two to five) clinical (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.61) and microbiological (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.76) remission rates. At the 'late' time point (days six to 10), antibiotics were found to still confer modest benefits in clinical remission (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.52). By days six to 10, 41% (95% CI 38 to 43) of cases had resolved in those receiving placebo. We found no data on the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics. No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, suggesting that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence. Although acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently self limiting, the findings from this updated systematic review suggest that the use of antibiotic eye drops is associated with modestly improved rates of clinical and microbiological remission in comparison to the use of placebo. Use of antibiotic eye drops should therefore be considered in order to speed the resolution of symptoms and infection.",,"antiinfective agent; eye drops; acute disease; conjunctivitis; human; induction chemotherapy; meta analysis; methodology; randomized controlled trial (topic); review; Acute Disease; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Conjunctivitis, Bacterial; Humans; Induction Chemotherapy; Ophthalmic Solutions; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","Sheikh, A.email: Aziz.Sheikh@ed.ac.uk",,,1469493X,,,"22972049","English","Cochrane Database Syst Rev",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873030592

Objective: The study reported in this paper aims to validate the QGS-based search process for SLR, i.e. whether a more effective (sensitive) and/or productive (precise) search can be achieved by following the QGS-based process. Method: We used a dual-case study, in which each case includes two observations of SE literature search for the same SLR but using and not using the QGS-based approach. The overall sensitivity and precision were calculated for each observation that implemented different search design. Results: The use of QGS-based search process resulted in higher sensitivity and precision in this dual-case study. Conclusions: A systematic search process can help capture more relevant studies as well as save researchers' time spent on literature search activities. Our observations also support that an integrated search strategy is recommended for SLRs in SE to avoid the possible limitations of applying a single (manual or automated) search method.",,"Empirical assessment; Literature search; Search method; Search process; Search strategies; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Time spent; Computer software selection and evaluation; Rating; Research; Software engineering","Zhang, H.; National ICT Australia, University of New South WalesAustralia; email: he.zhang@nicta.com.au",,,,9781849195096,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955171595

Aim: This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools to aid the process of teaching programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. Method: The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology has been selected to discover how effective the use of robotics has been in the teaching of introductory programming concepts. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals have been searched for literature relevant to the study. Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria 34 articles have been accepted in the SLR. 74% of included literature report robots to be an effective teaching tool and one that can help novice programmers in their studies. Conclusion: Robots can be a powerful and effective tool when used in an introductory programming course but the potential remains to further investigate methods for their implementation.

Aim: This study aims to identify under what conditions SLRs are likely to be stable, with respect to the primary studies selected, when used in software engineering. The conditions we investigate in this report are when novice researchers undertake searches with a common goal. Method: We undertook a participant-observer multi-case study to investigate the repeatability of systematic literature reviews. The 'cases' in this study were the early stages, involving identification of relevant literature, of two SLRs of unit testing methods. The SLRs were performed independently by two novice researchers. The SLRs were restricted to the ACM and IEEE digital libraries for the years 1986-2005 so their results could be compared with a published expert literature review of unit testing papers. Results: The two SLRs selected very different papers with only six papers out of 32 in common, and both differed substantially from a published secondary study of unit testing papers finding only three of 21 papers. Of the 29 additional papers found by the novice researchers, only 10 were considered relevant. The 10 additional relevant papers would have had an impact on the results of the published study by adding three new categories to the framework and adding papers to three, otherwise empty, cells. Conclusions: In the case of novice researchers, having broadly the same research question will not necessarily guarantee repeatability with respect to primary studies. Systematic reviews must be careful to report their search process fully or they will not be repeatable. Missing papers can have a significant impact on the stability of the results of a secondary study.","Case Study; Repeatability; Systematic Literature Review","Literature reviews; Repeatability; Research questions; Search process; Significant impacts; Systematic Literature Review; Systematic Review; Unit testing; Digital libraries; Publishing; Research; Software engineering; Paper","Kitchenham, B.; School of Computing and Mathematics, Keele University, Staffordshire ST5 5BG, United Kingdom; email: O.P.Brereton@cs.keele.ac.uk",,,,9781849195096,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955242432

Prior research suggests that results summarized in tables are often difficult for readers to understand. One alternative to improve results' comprehensibility is to use graphical representations. The aim of this work is twofold: first, to investigate whether graph representations result is better comprehensibility than tables when presenting SLR results; second, to investigate whether interpretation using graphs impacts on performance, as measured by the time consumed to analyse and understand the data. We selected an SLR published in the literature and used two different formats to represent its results - tables and graphs, in three different combinations: (i) table format only; (ii) graph format only; and (iii) a mixture of tables and graphs. We conducted an experiment that compared the performance and capability of experts in SLR, as well as doctoral and masters students, in analysing and understanding the results of the SLR, as presented in one of the three different forms. We were interested in examining whether there is difference between the performance of participants using tables and graphs. The graphical representation of SLR data led to a reduction in the time taken for its analysis, without any loss in data comprehensibility. For our sample the analysis of graphical data proved to be faster than the analysis of tabular data. However, we found no evidence of a difference in comprehensibility whether using tables, graphical format or a combination. Overall we argue that graphs are a suitable alternative to tables when it comes to representing the results of an SLR. © 2011 IEEE.","Systematic Literature Review; Visual Text Mining","Graph representation; Graphical data; Graphical format; Graphical representations; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Tabular data; Text mining; Software engineering; Graphic methods","Felizardo, K.R.; Department of Computer Science, University of São Paulo - USP, São Carlos, Brazil; email: katiarf@icmc.usp.br",,,,9780769546032,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Such techniques and tools are called proactive forensic approaches, i.e., approaches that can deal with digitally investigating an incident while it occurs. To come up with such an approach, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was undertaken to identify and map the processes in digital forensics investigation that exist in literature. According to the review, there is only one process that explicitly supports proactive forensics, the multi-component process [1]. However, this is a very high-level process and cannot be used to introduce automation and to build a proactive forensics system.

Since then evidence-based practice has become established across a range of disciplines, but it has received relatively little attention in IS. This paper explains the idea of evidence-based practice and reviews the related work found in the IS research literature. Some possible reasons for the lack of widespread adoption in IS are suggested. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs), a key research method in evidence-based practice, are explained. Recent developments in SLRs are discussed, which enable a richer and more nuanced approach to understanding information systems than found in conventional SLRs. It is proposed that these developments now make SLRs more suitable for synthesising empirical studies in IS. Greater use of SLRs by IS researchers would enable us to develop a cumulative knowledgebase of use to both researchers and practitioners.","Evidence-based; Systematic literature reviews","Empirical studies; Evidence-based; Evidence-based practices; Knowledge base; research methods; Systematic literature review; Occupational therapy; Research; Information systems","Oates, B.J.; Teesside University, School of Computing, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom; email: b.j.oates@tees.ac.uk",,,,,,,"English","Eur.

There is a need for an assessment framework that would assist adoption by evaluating the organisation, its key capabilities and processes affected by Clouds. The objective of this research study is to develop a model that helps organisations in assessing and improving their readiness for Cloud Computing. Primary data in this research are user concerns and issues that are barrier in the adoption of Clouds. The primary data will be collected using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology. Interviews with senior executives and IT Managers are planned to validate the findings of the SLR. The anticipated outcome of this project will be Cloud Computing Adoption Assessment Model (CAAM) that will help organizations to adopt and integrate Clouds with Enterprise IT, define new capabilities, identify their organisational readiness and provide strategies for successful adoption. The case study method will be used for evaluating CAAM in conjunction with organizations willing to adopt cloud computing. Three case studies are planned to evaluate the effectiveness of CAAM in assessing organisation's readiness for the adoption of Cloud Computing.

Method: We assess the results of a search process developed using a known set of papers by seeing whether it was able to identify papers from a different set of known papers. Results: Using a second set of known papers, we were able to show that a search process, which was based on a first set of known papers, was unlikely to be complete, even though the search process found all the papers in the first known set.

Lung disease is commonly encountered in rheumatological practice either as a manifestation of the underlying condition or as a consequence of using disease-modifying therapies. This has been particularly apparent with the TNF-α antagonists and exacerbations of interstitial lung disease (ILD). In view of this, we undertook a review of the current literature to identify non-infectious pulmonary complications associated with the newer biologic agents used for the treatment of rheumatic conditions.Methods. A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library and EMBASE for reviews, meta-analyses, clinical studies and randomized controlled trials, case studies and series, published up to June 2010 using the terms rituximab (RTX), certolizumab, golimumab (GOL), tocilizumab (TCZ) and abatacept in the advanced search option without limitations. In addition, abstracts from International Rheumatology conferences and unpublished data from the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency and drug manufacturers were used to complement our search. References were reviewed manually and only those articles that suggested a potential relationship between the biological agent and lung toxicity, following exclusion of other causes, were included.Results. Reported non-infectious pulmonary adverse events with TCZ included a fatal exacerbation of RA-associated ILD, new-onset ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and allergic pneumonitis, as well as three cases of microbiological culture-negative pneumonia. Although RTX had a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity, only 7 of the 121 cases reported involved rheumatological diseases. GOL treatment was associated with four cases of non-infectious pulmonary toxicity and two cases of pneumonia with negative microbiological studies. There were no episodes of pulmonary toxicity identified for either certolizumab or abatacept.Conclusion. Our results highlight an association between the use of newer biologic agents (TCZ, RTX and GOL) and the development of non-infectious parenchymal lung disease in patients with RA. Post-marketing surveillance and biologic registries will be critical for detecting further cases of ILD and improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of this process. As the use of these drugs increases, clinicians must remain vigilant for potential pulmonary complications and exercise caution in prescribing biologic therapies, particularly to rheumatological patients with pre-existing ILD. © The Author 2011.

The aims of this study were to explore the effectiveness of second-year undergraduate computing students in carrying out a systematic literature review and to identify the elements of the process that the students found most difficult. A multicase case study of students carrying out an assignment to perform a systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken. Students worked in groups and were studying across a range of computing programs. Data was collected from three sources: student grades, the comments made by the teaching staff on the submitted reports, and a debriefing questionnaire. All of the groups successfully completed the assignment. Results on which parts of the process were the most difficult were mixed, although much of the evidence suggests that the students found the conduct phase more problematic than the planning phase. It can be concluded that undergraduates can do SLRs, but the task is clearly quite challenging and time-consuming.

After an analysis of the 43 primary studies, we found that maintainability and reusability are the most relevant quality characteristics in this context. There is increasing interest in the evaluation and improvement of quality in the development of software which follows the SPL approach. In spite of this, no quality model specific to SPLs has yet been found which would meet with a consensus of general approval. For that reason, a standard quality model for SPLs is needed.

Such techniques and tools are called proactive forensic approaches, i.e., approaches that can deal with digitally investigating an incident while it occurs. To come up with such an approach, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was undertaken to identify and map the processes in digital forensics investigation that exist in literature. According to the review, there is only one process that explicitly supports proactive forensics, the multicomponent process [1]. However, this is a very high-level process and cannot be used to introduce automation and to build a proactive forensics system.

Methods: A systematic literature search and review was performed identifying the published studies evaluating RAMs and OMs for prehospital injury research. An explicit structured review of all articles pertaining to each measure was conducted using the previously established methodology developed by the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (""Physical Rehabilitation Outcome Measures""). Results: Among the 4,885 articles reviewed, 96 RAMs and/or OMs were identified from the existing literature (January 1958 to February 2010). Only one measure, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), currently meets Level 1 quality of evidence status and a Category 1 (strong) recommendation for use in EMS trauma research. Twelve RAMs or OMs received Category 2 status (promising, but not sufficient current evidence to strongly recommend), including the motor component of GCS, simplified motor score (SMS), the simplified verbal score (SVS), the revised trauma score (RTS), the prehospital index (PHI), EMS provider judgment, the revised trauma index (RTI), the rapid acute physiology score (RAPS), the rapid emergency medicine score (REMS), the field trauma triage (FTT), the pediatric triage rule, and the out-of-hospital decision rule for pediatrics. Conclusions: Using a previously published process, a structured literature review, and consensus expert panel opinion, only the GCS can currently be firmly recommended as a specific RAM or OM for prehospital trauma research (along with core measures that have already been established and published). This effort highlights the paucity of reliable, validated RAMs and OMs currently available for outcomes research in the prehospital setting and hopefully will encourage additional, methodologically sound evaluations of the promising, Category 2 RAMs and OMs, as well as the development of new measures. © 2011 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.",,"age; death; disability; emergency care; emergency health service; ethnicity; general aspects of disease; Glasgow coma scale; health care quality; heart rate; homelessness; human; injury; medical decision making; outcome assessment; outpatient care; panel study; patient satisfaction; physiotherapy; priority journal; race; review; risk assessment; sex; systematic review; vital sign; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pilot Projects; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Adjustment; Trauma Severity Indices","Beskind, D.L.; Department of Emergency Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, United States; email: dbeskind@aemrc.arizona.edu",,,10696563,,AEMEF,"21906205","English","Acad.

We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) of empirical studies that investigated factors affecting the effectiveness of PP for CS/SE students and studies that measured the effectiveness of PP for CS/SE students. Seventy-four papers were used in our synthesis of evidence, and 14 compatibility factors that can potentially affect PP's effectiveness as a pedagogical tool were identified. Results showed that students' skill level was the factor that affected PP's effectiveness the most. The most common measure used to gauge PP's effectiveness was time spent on programming. In addition, students' satisfaction when using PP was overall higher than when working solo. Our meta-analyses showed that PP was effective in improving students' grades on assignments. Finally, in the studies that used quality as a measure of effectiveness, the number of test cases succeeded, academic performance, and expert opinion were the quality measures mostly applied. The results of this SLR show two clear gaps in this research field: 1) a lack of studies focusing on pair compatibility factors aimed at making PP an effective pedagogical tool and 2) a lack of studies investigating PP for software design/modeling tasks in conjunction with programming tasks. © 2006 IEEE.","Empirical studies; pair programming; systematic review","Academic performance; Empirical studies; Expert opinion; Higher education; Measure of effectiveness; Meta analysis; Pair-programming; Pedagogical tools; Programming tasks; Quality measures; Research fields; Skill levels; Students' satisfaction; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Test case; Time spent; Teaching; Students","Salleh, N.; Department of Computer Science, International Islamic University Malaysia, PO Box 10, 50728 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; email: nsal017@ec.auckland.ac.nz",,,00985589,,IESED,,"English","IEEE Trans Software Eng",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959505364

This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) of peer-reviewed conference and journal articles published from 1997 through 2009 on the quality of conceptual models written in UML, undertaken to understand the state-of-the-art, and then identify any gaps in current research. Six digital libraries were searched, and 266 papers dealing specifically with the quality of UML models were identified and classified into five dimensions: type of model quality, type of evidence, type of research result, type of diagram, and research goal. The results indicate that most research focuses on semantic quality, with relatively little on semantic completeness; as such, this research examines new modeling methods vs. quality frameworks and metrics, as well as quality assurance vs. understanding quality issues. The results also indicate that more empirical research is needed to develop a theoretical understanding of conceptual model quality.

One critical step in applying this methodology is to design and execute appropriate and effective search strategy. This is a time-consuming and error-prone step, which needs to be carefully planned and implemented. There is an apparent need for a systematic approach to designing, executing, and evaluating a suitable search strategy for optimally retrieving the target literature from digital libraries. Objective: The main objective of the research reported in this paper is to improve the search step of undertaking SLRs in software engineering (SE) by devising and evaluating systematic and practical approaches to identifying relevant studies in SE. Method: We have systematically selected and analytically studied a large number of papers (SLRs) to understand the state-of-the-practice of search strategies in EBSE. Having identified the limitations of the current ad-hoc nature of search strategies used by SE researchers for SLRs, we have devised a systematic and evidence-based approach to developing and executing optimal search strategies in SLRs. The proposed approach incorporates the concept of 'quasi-gold standard' (QGS), which consists of collection of known studies, and corresponding 'quasi-sensitivity' into the search process for evaluating search performance. Results: We conducted two participant-observer case studies to demonstrate and evaluate the adoption of the proposed QGS-based systematic search approach in support of SLRs in SE research. Conclusion: We report their findings based on the case studies that the approach is able to improve the rigor of search process in an SLR, as well as it can serve as a supplement to the guidelines for SLRs in EBSE. We plan to further evaluate the proposed approach using a series of case studies on varying research topics in SE. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We believe it is essential that the SLR methodology is used constructively to support software engineering research. Objective: This study aims to assess the value of mapping studies which are a form of SLR that aims to identify and categorise the available research on a broad software engineering topic. Method: We used a multi-case, participant-observer case study using five examples of studies that were based on preceding mapping studies. We also validated our results by contacting two other researchers who had undertaken studies based on preceding mapping studies and by assessing review comments related to our follow-on studies. Results: Our original case study identified 11 unique benefits that can accrue from basing research on a preceding mapping study of which only two were case specific. We also identified nine problems associated with using preceding mapping studies of which two were case specific. These results were consistent with the information obtained from the validation activities. We did not find an example of an independent research group making use of a mapping study produced by other researchers. Conclusion: Mapping studies can save time and effort for researchers and provide baselines to assist new research efforts.

Many of the technical challenges pertaining to the development of SBAs have been addressed, however, there are still outstanding questions relating to the processes required to develop them. Objective: The objective of this study is to systematically identify process models for developing service-based applications (SBAs) and review the processes within them. This will provide a useful starting point for any further research in the area. A secondary objective of the study is to identify process models which facilitate the adaptation of SBAs. Method: In order to achieve this objective a systematic literature review (SLR) of the existing software engineering literature is conducted. Results: During this research 722 studies were identified using a predefined search strategy, this number was narrowed down to 57 studies based on a set of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results are reported both quantitatively in the form of a mapping study, as well as qualitatively in the form of a narrative summary of the key processes identified. Conclusion: There are many process models reported for the development of SBAs varying in detail and maturity, this review has identified and categorised the processes within those process models.

Methods: AIIRD, vaccines and immunomodulating drugs, as well as eight key questions were defined by the multidisciplinary expert committee commissioned by EULAR for developing the recommendations. A SLR was performed using MedLine through October 2009 and including data from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized trials, and observational studies, excluding case series with ≤ 5 participants. Articles in English and regarding patients ≤ 16. years of age, were eligible. Results: Several vaccine-preventable infections (VPI) occur more often in AIIRD-patients and most vaccines are efficacious in AIIRD-patients, even when treated with immunomodulating agents, except rituximab. There does not appear to be an increase in vaccination-related harms in vaccinated patients with AIIRD in comparison with unvaccinated patients with AIIRD. However, these studies are underpowered and therefore not conclusive. Conclusion: Based on the current evidence from the literature, recommendations for vaccination in patients with AIIRD were made. However, more research is needed in particular regarding incidence of VPI, harms of vaccination and the influence of (new and established) immunomodulating agents on vaccination efficacy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",,"abatacept; adalimumab; azathioprine; BCG vaccine; cholera vaccine; corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin; diphtheria vaccine; etanercept; hepatitis A vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; hydroxychloroquine; immunomodulating agent; infliximab; Japanese encephalitis vaccine; leflunomide; measles vaccine; methotrexate; mumps vaccine; mycophenolic acid; recombinant interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; rituximab; salazosulfapyridine; tacrolimus; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor; unindexed drug; vaccine; Wart virus vaccine; adult disease; article; autoimmune disease; evidence based medicine; human; immunomodulation; inflammatory disease; rheumatic disease; systematic review; vaccination; Adult; Antirheumatic Agents; Autoimmune Diseases; Disease Susceptibility; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Immunization, Secondary; Immunologic Factors; Opportunistic Infections; Rheumatic Diseases; Vaccination; Vaccines","Van Assen, S.; University Medical Center Groningen, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, AA41, PO box 30 001, 9700 RB Groningen, Netherlands; email: s.van.assen@int.umcg.nl",,,15689972,,ARUEB,"21182987","English","Autoimmun.

Objective: The objective of this research paper is to identify and analyse factors that are important in terms of the competitiveness of vendor organisations in attracting outsourcing projects. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) by applying our customised search strings which were derived from our research questions. We performed all the SLR steps, such as the protocol development, initial selection, final selection, quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis. Results: We have identified factors such as cost-saving, skilled human resource, appropriate infrastructure, quality of product and services, efficient outsourcing relationships management, and an organisation's track record of successful projects which are generally considered important by the outsourcing clients. Our results indicate that appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, and skilled human resource are common in three continents, namely Asia, North America and Europe. We identified appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, and quality of products and services as being common in three types of organisations (small, medium and large). We have also identified four factors-appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, quality of products and services, and skilled human resource as being common in the two decades (1990-1999 and 2000-mid 2008). Conclusions: Cost-saving should not be considered as the driving factor in the selection process of software development outsourcing vendors. Vendors should rather address other factors in order to compete in the OSDO business, such as skilled human resource, appropriate infrastructure and quality of products and services. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR. © 2011 IEEE.","Evidence-based software engineering (EBSE); Study selection activity; Systematic literature review (SLR); Visual text mining (VTM)","Software engineering; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Research questions; Study selection activities; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Text mining; Time spent; Visual text minings (VTM); Data mining","Felizardo, K.R.; Depart. of Computer Science, University of São PauloBrazil; email: katiarf@icmc.usp.br",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,,,,"English","Int.

Several researchers have also been working on improving the scientific and technological support for SLRs in SE. We argue that there is also an essential need for evidence-based body of knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of SLRs in SE. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this research is to empirically investigate the adoption and use of SLRs in SE research from various perspectives. METHOD: We used multi-method approach as it is based on a combination of complementary research methods which are expected to compensate each others' limitations. RESULTS: A large majority of the participants are convinced of the value of using a rigorous and systematic methodology for literature reviews. However, there are concerns about the required time and resources for SLRs. One of the most important motivators for performing SLRs is new findings and inception of innovative ideas for further research. The reported SLRs are more influential compared to the traditional literature reviews in terms of number of citations. One of the main challenges of conducting SLRs is drawing a balance between rigor and required effort. CONCLUSIONS: SLR has become a popular research methodology for conducting literature review and evidence aggregation in SE. There is an overall positive perception about this methodology. The findings provide interesting insights into different aspects of SLRs. We expect that the findings can provide valuable information to readers on what can be expected from conducting SLRs and the potential impact of such reviews. © 2011 IEEE.","Evidence-based software engineering; Methodology adoption; Systematic (literature) reviews","Empirical investigation; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Methodology adoption; Multi-method approach; Research methodologies; Systematic (literature) review; Systematic methodology; Technological supports; Software engineering","Zhang, H.; National ICT Australia, University of New South WalesAustralia; email: he.zhang@nicta.com.au",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,,,,"English","Int.

Two tertiary studies, published in 2009 and 2010, identified and analysed 54 SLRs published in journals and conferences in the period between 1st January 2004 and 30th June 2008. Objective: In this article, our goal was to extend and update the two previous tertiary studies to cover the period between 1st July 2008 and 31st December 2009. We analysed the quality, coverage of software engineering topics, and potential impact of published SLRs for education and practice. Method: We performed automatic and manual searches for SLRs published in journals and conference proceedings, analysed the relevant studies, and compared and integrated our findings with the two previous tertiary studies. Results: We found 67 new SLRs addressing 24 software engineering topics. Among these studies, 15 were considered relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum, and 40 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. We found that the number of SLRs in software engineering is increasing, the overall quality of the studies is improving, and the number of researchers and research organisations worldwide that are conducting SLRs is also increasing and spreading. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the software engineering research community is starting to adopt SLRs consistently as a research method. However, the majority of the SLRs did not evaluate the quality of primary studies and fail to provide guidelines for practitioners, thus decreasing their potential impact on software engineering practice. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: The objective is to identify various barriers that have a negative impact on software outsourcing clients in the selection process of offshore software development outsourcing vendors. Method: We have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) process for the identification of barriers. We have performed all the SLR steps such as the protocol development, initial selection, final selection, quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis. Results: We have identified barriers such as ""language and cultural barriers"", ""country instability"", ""lack of project management"", ""lack of protection for intellectual property rights"" and ""lack of technical capability"" that generally have a negative impact on outsourcing clients. We have identified only one common frequently cited barrier in three types of organisations (i.e. small, medium and large) which is ""language and cultural barriers"". We did not identify any common frequently cited barrier in three continents (Asia, North America and Europe) and in two decades (1990-1999 and 2000-mid 2008). The results also reveal the similarities and differences in the barriers identified through different study strategies. Conclusions: Vendors should address frequently cited barriers such as ""language and cultural barriers"", ""country instability"", ""lack of project management"", ""lack of protection for intellectual property rights"" and ""lack of technical capability"" in order to compete in the offshore outsourcing business. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It is commonly accepted that a good quality experiment is bias free. Bias is considered to be related to internal validity (e.g., how adequately the experiment is planned, executed and analysed). Quality assessment is usually conducted using checklists and quality scales. It has not yet been proven; however, that quality is related to experimental bias. Aim: Identify whether there is a relationship between internal validity and bias in software engineering experiments. Method: We built a quality scale to determine the quality of the studies, which we applied to 28 experiments included in two systematic literature reviews. We proposed an objective indicator of experimental bias, which we applied to the same 28 experiments. Finally, we analysed the correlations between the quality scores and the proposed measure of bias. Results: We failed to find a relationship between the global quality score (resulting from the quality scale) and bias; however, we did identify interesting correlations between bias and some particular aspects of internal validity measured by the instrument. Conclusions: There is an empirically provable relationship between internal validity and bias. It is feasible to apply quality assessment in systematic literature reviews, subject to limits on the internal validity aspects for consideration. © 2011 IEEE.","Checklist; Quality assessment (QA) of experiments; Quality scale; Systematic literature review (SLR)","Quality control; Software engineering; Checklist; Experimental bias; Quality assessment; Quality scale; Quantitative determinations; Software engineering experiments; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Professional aspects","Dieste, O.; Facultad de Informática, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; email: odieste@fi.upm.es",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,,,,"English","Int.

Carlos III, s/n, 45071 Toledo, Spain","Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) have been gaining a significant amount of attention from Software Engineering researchers since 2004. SLRs are considered to be a new research methodology in Software Engineering, which allow evidence to be gathered with regard to the usefulness or effectiveness of the technology proposed in Software Engineering for the development and maintenance of software products. This is demonstrated by the growing number of publications related to SLRs that have appeared in recent years. While some tools exist that can support some or all of the activities of the SLR processes defined in (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007), these are not free. The objective of this paper is to present the SLR-Tool, which is a free tool and is available on the following website: http://alarcosj.esi.uclm.es/SLRTool/, to be used by researchers from any discipline, and not only Software Engineering. SLR-Tool not only supports the process of performing SLRs proposed in (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007), but also provides additional functionalities such as: refining searches within the documents by applying text mining techniques; defining a classification schema in order to facilitate data synthesis; exporting the results obtained to the format of tables and charts; and exporting the references from the primary studies to the formats used in bibliographic packages such as EndNote, BibTeX or Ris. This tool has, to date, been used by members of the Alarcos Research Group and PhD students, and their perception of it is that it is both highly necessary and useful. Our purpose now is to circulate the use of SLR-Tool throughout the entire research community in order to obtain feedback from other users.","SLR; Systematic Literature Review; Text mining; Tool","Data synthesis; Research communities; Research groups; Research methodologies; SLR; Software products; Systematic Literature Review; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Bibliographic retrieval systems; Computer software maintenance; Research; Software engineering; Text processing; Equipment","Bocco, M.

Adapting the procedures involved in such a review to meet the needs of software engineering and its literature remains an ongoing process. As part of this process of refinement, we undertook two case studies which aimed 1) to compare the use of targeted manual searches with broad automated searches and 2) to compare different methods of reaching a consensus on quality. For Case 1, we compared a tertiary study of systematic literature reviews published between January 1, 2004 and June 30, 2007 which used a manual search of selected journals and conferences and a replication of that study based on a broad automated search. We found that broad automated searches find more studies than manual restricted searches, but they may be of poor quality. Researchers undertaking SLRs may be justified in using targeted manual searches if they intend to omit low quality papers, or they are assessing research trends in research methodologies. For Case 2, we analyzed the process used to evaluate the quality of SLRs. We conclude that if quality evaluation of primary studies is a critical component of a specific SLR, assessments should be based on three independent evaluators incorporating at least two rounds of discussion. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Automated search; Broad search; Case study; Manual search; Mapping studies; Quality evaluation process; Systematic literature review; Targeted search","Automated searches; Broad search; Case study; Manual search; Mapping studies; Quality evaluation; Systematic literature review; Targeted search; Automation; Refining; Research; Software engineering; Quality control","Kitchenham, B.

Vendor's readiness plays an important role in the successful outcomes of outsourcing projects. OBJECTIVE - The objective of this paper is to describe the preliminary structure of software outsourcing vendors' readiness model (SOVRM). METHOD - In order to develop SOVRM, we have performed systematic literature review (SLR) to identify critical success factors (CSFs) and critical barriers (CBs). To validate SLR findings and to find practices for the identified CSFs and CBs a questionnaire survey was conducted in the outsourcing industry. Case study approach was used for the evaluation of SOVRM. RESULTS - The SOVRM has been developed to assist software development outsourcing organisations in measuring and improving their outsourcing readiness prior to start outsourcing activities. CONCLUSIONS - SOVRM is a useful tool for offshore software development outsourcing vendors in assessing their readiness for offshore outsourcing activities. Vendors should address each CSFs and CBs in order to achieve a certain SOVRM level. © 2010 ACM.","offshore software outsourcing; outsourcing; readiness; vendors' readiness","Case study approach; Contractual business; Cost-saving; Critical success factor; High-quality software; Offshore Outsourcing; Outsourcing projects; Questionnaire surveys; readiness; Software outsourcing; Systematic literature review; vendors' readiness; Electric circuit breakers; Outsourcing; Surveys; Software design","Khan, S.U.; School of Computing and Mathematics, Keele University, ST5 5BG, United Kingdom; email: s.khan@epsam.keele.ac.uk",,,,9781450302814,,,"English","ACM Int.

In this paper recommendations for the treatment of RA with synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and glucocorticoids (GCs) that also account for strategic algorithms and deal with economic aspects, are described. The recommendations are based on evidence from five systematic literature reviews (SLRs) performed for synthetic DMARDs, biological DMARDs, GCs, treatment strategies and economic issues. The SLR-derived evidence was discussed and summarised as an expert opinion in the course of a Delphi-like process. Levels of evidence, strength of recommendations and levels of agreement were derived. Fifteen recommendations were developed covering an area from general aspects such as remission/low disease activity as treatment aim via the preference for methotrexate monotherapy with or without GCs vis-à-vis combination of synthetic DMARDs to the use of biological agents mainly in patients for whom synthetic DMARDs and tumour necrosis factor inhibitors had failed. Cost effectiveness of the treatments was additionally examined. These recommendations are intended to inform rheumatologists, patients and other stakeholders about a European consensus on the management of RA with DMARDs and GCs as well as strategies to reach optimal outcomes of RA, based on evidence and expert opinion.",,"abatacept; adalimumab; azathioprine; certolizumab pegol; chloroquine; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin A; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; etanercept; glucocorticoid; gold salt; golimumab; hydroxychloroquine; infliximab; leflunomide; methotrexate; rituximab; tocilizumab; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; add on therapy; algorithm; article; clinical trial; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; Delphi study; disease activity; economic aspect; Europe; human; medical literature; outcome assessment; phase 2 clinical trial; phase 3 clinical trial; physician; priority journal; remission; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatology; strength; treatment failure; Algorithms; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Evidence-Based Medicine; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha","Smolen, J.

However, it is not known whether these classifications are comparable. The aim of this study was to review systematically the literature to compare the healing rates of erosive oesophagitis with PPIs in clinical trials assessed by the HD, SM, or LA classifications. Methods: A recursive, English language literature search in PubMed and Cochrane databases to December 2006 was performed. Double-blind randomized control trials comparing a PPI with another PPI, an H2-RA or placebo using endoscopic assessment of the healing of oesophagitis by the HD, SM or LA, or their modified classifications at 4 or 8 weeks, were included in the study. The healing rates on treatment with the same PPI(s), and same endoscopic grade(s) were pooled and compared between different classifications using Fisher's exact test or χ test where appropriate. Results: Forty-seven studies from 965 potential citations met inclusion criteria. Seventy-eight PPI arms were identified, with 27 using HD, 29 using SM, and 22 using LA for five marketed PPIs. There was insufficient data for rabeprazole and esomeprazole (week 4 only) to compare because they were evaluated by only one classification. When data from all PPIs were pooled, regardless of baseline oesophagitis grades, the LA healing rate was significantly higher than SM and HD at both 4 and 8 weeks (74, 71, and 68% at 4 weeks and 89, 84, and 83% at 8 weeks, respectively). The distribution of different grades in study population was available only for pantoprazole where it was not significantly different between LA and SM subgroups. When analyzing data for PPI and dose, the LA classification showed a higher healing rate for omeprazole 20 mg/day and pantoprazole 40 mg/day (significant at 8 weeks), whereas healing by SM classification was significantly higher for omeprazole 40 mg/day (no data for LA) and lansoprazole 30 mg/day at 4 and 8 weeks. The healing rate by individual oesophagitis grade was not always available or robust enough for meaningful analysis. However, a difference between classifications remained. Conclusion: There is a significant, but not always consistent, difference in oesophagitis healing rates with the same PPI(s) reported by the LA, SM, or HD classifications. The possible difference between grading classifications should be considered when interpreting or comparing healing rates for oesophagitis from different studies. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","Classification; Erosive oesophagitis; Impact","esomeprazole; lansoprazole; omeprazole; pantoprazole; proton pump inhibitor; rabeprazole; article; clinical assessment tool; clinical trial; Cochrane Library; comparative study; disease classification; EMBASE; evaluation and follow up; Fisher exact test; healing; hetzel dent classification; human; los angeles classification; MEDLINE; priority journal; reflux esophagitis; savary miller classification; systematic review; treatment outcome; 2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles; Databases, Factual; Endoscopy, Gastrointestinal; Esophagitis; Humans; Omeprazole; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Registries; Wound Healing","Hunt, R.

An inference strategy is a method by which a user can infer secret information using the information which they are allowed to access through the access control mechanism. The aim of this paper is to collate and categorise the set of inference strategies in the existing literature. The systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is used to identify and categorise known inference strategies. The SLR search found 63 sources, and 127 inference strategies were extracted from these sources, which have been categorised into 11 different categories. Recording the inference strategy processes has abstracted the detail which ties inference strategies to an information system. Using this abstraction, it should be feasible to determine the level of inference protection offered by information systems in general.

Objective: The aim of this on-going research is to provide an annotated catalogue of SLRs available to software engineering researchers and practitioners. This study updates our previous study using a broad automated search. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs published in the time period 1st January 2004 to 30th June 2008. We contrast the number, quality and source of these SLRs with SLRs found in the original study. Results: Our broad search found an additional 35 SLRs corresponding to 33 unique studies. Of these papers, 17 appeared relevant to the undergraduate educational curriculum and 12 appeared of possible interest to practitioners. The number of SLRs being published is increasing. The quality of papers in conferences and workshops has improved as more researchers use SLR guidelines. Conclusion: SLRs appear to have gone past the stage of being used solely by innovators but cannot yet be considered a main stream software engineering research methodology. They are addressing a wide range of topics but still have limitations, such as often failing to assess primary study quality. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: We followed the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) standardised procedures for guideline development. The following techniques were applied: nominal groups, Delphi surveys for prioritisation, small group discussion, systematic literature review and two Delphi rounds to obtain agreement. The panel included rheumatologists, internists, dermatologists, a nephrologist and an expert related to national research agencies. The level of evidence and grading of recommendations were determined according to the Levels of Evidence and Grades of Recommendations of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Results: A total of 10 recommendations have been developed, covering the following aspects: patient assessment, cardiovascular risk factors, other risk factors (osteoporosis, cancer), infection risk (screening, vaccination, monitoring), frequency of assessments, laboratory tests, mucocutaneous involvement, kidney monitoring, neuropsychological manifestations and ophthalmology assessment. A 'core set' of minimal variables for the assessment and monitoring of patients with SLE in clinical practice was developed that included some of the recommendations. In addition to the recommendations, indications for specific organ assessments that were viewed as part of good clinical practice were discussed and included in the flow chart. Conclusions: A set of recommendations for monitoring patients with SLE in routine clinical practice has been developed. The use of a standardised core set to monitor patients with SLE should facilitate clinical practice, as well as the quality control of care for patients with SLE, and the collection and comparison of data in observational studies.",,"chloroquine; complement component C3; complement component C4; corticosteroid; creatinine; double stranded DNA; glucocorticoid; hydroxychloroquine; immunosuppressive agent; influenza vaccine; phospholipid antibody; Pneumococcus vaccine; prednisone; protein; Sm antibody; article; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular disease; clinical practice; clinical study; cognitive defect; comorbidity; comparative study; creatinine blood level; cytomegalovirus infection; Delphi study; dermatologist; drug megadose; evidence based medicine; eye care; glaucoma; good clinical practice; headache; health care organization; health survey; human; infection; infection risk; kidney; laboratory test; medical research; medical specialist; mood disorder; neoplasm; nephrologist; neuropsychology; observational study; ophthalmology; osteoporosis; patient assessment; patient care; patient monitoring; practice guideline; priority journal; proteinuria; quality control; retinopathy; rheumatic disease; rheumatology; risk factor; screening; seizure; skin disease; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; vaccination; cardiovascular disease; conference paper; consensus development; long term care; lupus erythematosus nephritis; methodology; opportunistic infection; skin lupus erythematosus; standard; systemic lupus erythematosus; Cardiovascular Diseases; Delphi Technique; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Long-Term Care; Lupus Erythematosus, Cutaneous; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Lupus Nephritis; Opportunistic Infections; Risk Factors","Mosca, M.; University of Pisa, Ospedale S.

Several researchers have reported their experiences of and lessons learned from applying systematic reviews to different subject matters in software engineering. However, there has been no attempt at independently exploring experiences and perceptions of the practitioners of systematic reviews in order to gain an in-depth understanding of various aspects of systemic reviews as a new research methodology in software engineering. We assert that there is a need of evidence-based body of knowledge about the application of systematic reviews in software engineering. To address this need, we have started an empirical research program that aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge about systematic reviews in software engineering. This paper reports the design, logistics, and results of the first phase empirical study carried out in this program. The results provide interesting insights into different aspects of systematic reviews based on the analysis of the data gathered from 17 interviewees with varying levels of knowledge of and experiences in systematic reviews. The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the existing knowledge about using systematic reviews and help further improve the state-of-the-practice of this research methodology in software engineering. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Body of knowledge; Empirical research; Empirical studies; In-depth understanding; Lessons learned; Research methodologies; Subject matters; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Computer software; Research; Knowledge engineering","Babar, M.

Urinary diversion is designed to improve or replace the function of the diseased urinary bladder. Methods: Studies reporting on surgery involving intestinal segments transposed into the urinary tract were identified between January 1990 and January 2007 using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. All articles published in English language reporting on at least 10 patients and follow-up of at least 1 year were included. This is a substantive update of our previously published systematic review that reported on the evidence between January and to January 2003 (Nabi G, Yong SM, Ong E, et al. J Urol. 2005;174:21-28). Results: Between January 1990 and January 2007, a total of 5651 abstracts were reviewed. Of them, 557 studies met the inclusion criteria reporting on 46 921 participants (an additional 14 126 participants reported on between January 2003 and January 2007). Operative complications were lowest in ileal conduit diversion, whereas postoperative morbidity and mortality were lower for orthotopic bladder replacement surgery. Of the 35 quality-of-life studies, only 2 studies (Dutta SC, Chang SC, Coffey CS, et al. J Urol. 2002;168:164-167; Hobisch A, Tosun K, Kinzl J, et al. World J Urol. 2000;18:338-344) reported a better quality of life with orthotopic bladder replacement. Conclusions: This systematic review update fails to reveal a clear winner, with each intervention type having advantages and disadvantages. With > 46 000 patients included in transposed intestinal segment research over the past 16 years, it is surely a criticism of our speciality that we are no closer to answering the question of what is the best way to improve or replace the function of the diseased bladder. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, the student found 28 publications reporting empirical studies of pair programming, of which nine publications were used for data extraction and analysis. Results of the review indicates that whilst pair programming has little effect on the marks obtained for examinations and assignments, it can significantly improve the pass and retention rates and the students' confidence and enjoyment of programming.

The objective of this study was to develop recommendations based on scientific evidence and opinions of experts on the use of MTX, which will allow the improvement of our clinical practice. Methods: 3E (Evidence, Expertise, Exchange) Initiative in Rheumatology is a multinational group of rheumatologists from 17 countries, including Brazil. After a selection of 10 questions about the use of MTX, held by the Delphi method, a systematic literature review (SLR) was done (Medline, Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, Abstracts EULAR 2005-2007 and ACR 2006-2007) by six international bibliographic reviewers chosen by the mentors of the 3E study. Two other different national questions from Brazil were also included, and the SLR was done by a national bibliographic reviewer.** The results of SLR were presented by 7 members of our Brazilian 3E scientific committee* at a meeting of 48 rheumatologists, which discussed RSL details, voted, and produced the national recommendations presented here. These recommendations were subsequently used in the creation of multinational recommendations. Results and conclusions: 21 recommendations concerning the 10 international and the 2 national questions were formulated, with an agreement level of 77% among the participants (63-100%). Oral MTX should be started at a minimum dose of 10 mg/wk and a maximum dose of 25 mg/wk. Elevation of AST/ALT above 3x the upper limit, for at least 3 times consecutively, justifies the temporary suspension of MTX, which can be restored after normalization of serum liver enzyme levels; MTX is safe for long term use. The use of alcohol (100 g/wk) should be avoided. Combinations of MTX with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs are recommended, although there is risk of greater toxicity. Folic acid should be associated with MTX in dose higher than 5 mg/wk. Total blood cell count, creatinine, AST/ALT, serology for hepatitis B and C virus, and chest X-ray should be ordered before initiating MTX. Inquire about contraception methods, comorbidities, use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and liver diseases and hepatotoxic drugs should be performed. The MTX can be maintained during elective surgeries; discontinuation of MTX for at least 3 months before planning of pregnancy is suggested, for both men and women Use of contraception method is justified with the use of MTX in reproductive age. MTX can be used to reduce the cumulative dose of corticosteroid in patients with giant cell arthritis, rheumatic polymyalgia (RPM), juvenile dermatomyositis, and in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with cutaneous or joint involvement.","Methotrexate; Rheumatoid arthritis","alcohol; azathioprine; corticosteroid; creatinine; cyclosporin; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; folic acid; folinic acid; hepatitis B vaccine; illicit drug; influenza vaccine; leflunomide; methotrexate; placebo; Pneumococcus vaccine; salazosulfapyridine; article; blood cell count; Brazil; clinical practice; clinical trial; Cochrane Library; comorbidity; contraception; Delphi study; dermatomyositis; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug use; drug withdrawal; elective surgery; EMBASE; gastrointestinal toxicity; giant cell arteritis; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; human; liver disease; liver toxicity; low drug dose; MEDLINE; polymyositis; practice guideline; psoriatic arthritis; rheumatic disease; rheumatic polymyalgia; rheumatoid arthritis; serology; side effect; systemic lupus erythematosus; thorax radiography; treatment planning; vasculitis","Pereira, I.

In clinical practice as well as in clinical trials, MTX is the gold standard for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Nevertheless, a survey by the international 3E-initiative (Evidence, Experts, Exchange) among national and international experts identified 10 questions regarding the clinical use of MTX that had not yet been clarified. Therefore, it was the goal of this project to develop evidence-based recommendations on the use of MTX. Materials and Methods: Between January and April 2007, experts from 17 countries agreed on 10 questions regarding the use of MTX. For answering these questions, ""multinational fellows"" performed a systematic literature research (SLR) up to October 2007. The SLR was completed according to the current recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration and its results were presented to national groups of experts. Out of 17 000 articles retrieved by the SLR, only 304 articles were found to be applicable for answering the 10 questions. Based on these articles, recommendations were developed using a Delphi procedure. Results: The 10 questions were divided into three topics: (A) therapeutic strategies, (B) treatment safety - monitoring and prevention and (C) treatment safety - complications. At the national meetings guided by the scientific committee, 68 German rheumatologists developed 10 recommendations in an interactive setting with a mean degree of acceptance of 90 %. Conclusion: The 3E-initiative has demonstrated that, despite long-standing experience with MTX, several issues with regard to its use in rheumatic diseases are currently unclear. The evidence-based recommendations on the use Schlussfolgerungen: Die 3E-Initiative hat aufgezeigt, dass hin- sichtlich des praktischen Einsatzes von MTX bei rheumatischen Erkrankungen trotz langjähriger Erfahrung wichtige Fragen unzureichend geklärt sind. Die hier referierten evidenzbasier- ten Empfehlungen zu Anwendung, Therapieuberwachung und Management therapeutischer Komplikationen stellen einen na- tionalen Konsens erfahrener Experten dar, haben für die rheu- matologische Praxis hohe Bedeutung und können als Basis zur Erarbeitung von zukünftigen Therapierichtlinien dienen. and monitoring of MTX as well as the management of therapeutic complications reported in this article represent the national consensus of experienced experts in the field and are of high importance for daily practice in rheumatology and for the development of future therapeutic recommendations.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG.","Dosing; Folic acid; Methotrexate; Monitoring; Pregnancy","methotrexate; drug indication; evidence based medicine; gold standard; human; immunosuppressive treatment; outcome assessment; practice guideline; review; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatology","Müller-Ladner, U.; Lehrstuhl für Innere Medizin Mit Schwerpunkt Rheumatologie, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen Abteilung für Rheumatologie, Und Klinische Immunologie Kerckhoff-Klinik, Benekestr. 2-8, 61231 Bad Nauheim, Germany; email: u.mueller-ladner@kerckhoff-klinik.de",,,0341051X,,AKRHD,,"German","Aktuel.

Aims: This study assesses the impact of systematic literature reviews (SLRs) which are the recommended EBSE method for aggregating evidence. Method: We used the standard systematic literature review method employing a manual search of 10 journals and 4 conference proceedings. Results: Of 20 relevant studies, eight addressed research trends rather than technique evaluation. Seven SLRs addressed cost estimation. The quality of SLRs was fair with only three scoring less than 2 out of 4. Conclusions: Currently, the topic areas covered by SLRs are limited. European researchers, particularly those at the Simula Laboratory appear to be the leading exponents of systematic literature reviews. The series of cost estimation SLRs demonstrate the potential value of EBSE for synthesising evidence and making it available to practitioners. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The guidelines suggest that the list can be used to construct a tailored set of questions to evaluate the quality of primary studies. Aim: This paper aims to evaluate whether the list of quality criteria help researchers construct tailored quality checklists. Method: We undertook a participant-observer case study to investigate the list of quality criteria. The “case” in this study was the planning stage of a systematic literature review on unit testing. Results: The checklists in our SLR guidelines do not provide sufficient help with the construction of a quality checklist for a specific SLR either for novices or for experienced researchers. However, the checklists are reasonably complete and lead to the use of a common terminology for quality questions selected for a specific systematic literature review. Conclusions: The guidelines document should be amended to include a much shorter generic checklist. Researchers might find it useful to adopt a team-based process for quality checklist construction and provide suggestions for answering quality checklist questions. © 2009 BCS Learning and Development Ltd.

As such, when scoping out a doctoral or policy based study the Structured Literature Review (SLR) as espoused by Tranfield et al (2003) can be considered as a means by which critical literature central to and underpinning the research can be rigorously and systematically mapped out. However, there is little guidance, or evidence, of this being the case when undertaking small scale projects for example undergraduate or masters degree dissertations.This paper reports four case studies using semi-structured interviews of master's degree students following management programmes who undertook a Structured Literature Review (SLR) based dissertation and the issues and problems they had to encounter during their journey. The findings from the case studies suggest that Tranfield et al's (2003) approach to SLR's, whilst suited to doctoral level and policy based research is not appropriate when dealing with undergraduate and masters dissertations and projects. The case study findings identified that these students conducting a SLR had to deal with a new set of conceptual, methodological and data collection problems relating to this 'unorthodox' approach to conducting a postgraduate research dissertation. The findings show that students had to confront new paradigms of enquiry that are not normally taught or found in 'traditional' research texts and research methods courses that are taught on degree programmes. However, the findings do reveal that students gained a greater depth and insight into the subject they were researching through a more rigorous and structured approach.The paper then presents alternative remedies by way of the Rapid Structured Literature Review (RSLR) research strategy which is argued as an appropriate approach in conducting small scale literature based research projects when used with undergraduate and master's degree students rather than the SLR espoused by Tranfield et al (2003) which is better suited for other types of research such as doctoral and policy based activities. ©Academic Conferences Ltd.","Literature-based research; Rapid structured literature reviews; Synthesis; Systematic literature reviews",,"Armitage, A.; Anglia Ruskin University, Essex, United Kingdom; email: a.m.d.armitage@anglia.ac.uk",,,14777029,,,,"English","Electron.

Formally, Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are a part of EBSE. There has been a noticeable take up of SLRs by researchers, but little has been published on whether, and then how, the EBSE methodology has been applied in full. Objectives: To empirically evaluate the use of EBSE by undergraduate students. To consider how insights into the students’ performance with EBSE can be applied to software practitioners’ expected performance with EBSE. To gain insights into the use of Supplementary EBSE Guidelines and associated Assessment Schemes. Method: 37 final-year undergraduate students completed a coursework assessment that required them to use EBSE to evaluate one or more of four Requirements Management Tools (RMTs): Telelogic DOORs®, Borland’s Caliber® Analyst, Compuware Optimal Trace™, and GODA ARTS. Students were provided with a range of EBSE resources, including a set of Supplementary EBSE Guidelines, to assist them with their EBSE evaluation. An Assessment Scheme was development to assess the degree to which students followed the Supplementary Guidelines. A feedback questionnaire, completed by 12 of the 37 students, complemented the Assessment Scheme. Results: 78% of students chose to evaluate a RMT that is currently a market leader. 62% of students subsequently recommended the adoption of their chosen RTM. Some students made a recommendation because the Guidelines indicated they should, rather than making a recommendation because the evidence ‘entailed’ that recommendation. Only 8% of students intentionally made no recommendation, and this seems to be on the basis of the poor quality of evidence available on the chosen RMT(s). All 12 students who completed the feedback questionnaire reported that this was the hardest or nearly the hardest assessment that the student had ever done! 67% of these 12 students reported that they had not given themselves sufficient time to complete the evaluation, and 83% reported that they had to balance their time on this evaluation with other commitments. The12 students found EBSE steps 1 and 4 to be the easiest and EBSE steps 2 and 3 to be the hardest, and they generally reported that they had received sufficient support from the EBSE resources made available to them. Conclusion: This study presents independent, empirical evidence of the full use of EBSE, to complement the growing body of published SLRs. We believe that the findings on students’ use of EBSE are relevant to understanding professional practitioners’ prospective use of EBSE. Both students and professionals would: find EBSE very challenging, in particular the SLRs; be subject to constraints and trade-offs; may not be able to find relevant and rigorous evidence; and may make errors in their critical thinking whilst conducting the evaluation.

We undertook a comprehensive meta-analysis to identify genotype-phenotype relationships to further understand the clinical variability and genetic factors involved in SMS. Clinical and molecular information on 105 patients with SMS was obtained through research protocols and a review of the literature and analyzed using Fisher's exact test with two-tailed p values. Several differences in these groups of patients were identified based on genotype and gender. Patients with RAI1 mutation were more likely to exhibit overeating, obesity, polyembolokoilamania, self-hugging, muscle cramping, and dry skin and less likely to have short stature, hearing loss, frequent ear infections, and heart defects when compared with patients with deletion, while a subset of small deletion cases with deletions spanning from TNFRSF13B to MFAP4 was less likely to exhibit brachycephaly, dental anomalies, iris abnormalities, head-banging, and hyperactivity. Significant differences between genders were also identified, with females more likely to have myopia, eating/appetite problems, cold hands and feet, and frustration with communication when compared with males. These results confirm previous findings and identify new genotype-phenotype associations including differences in the frequency of short stature, hearing loss, ear infections, obesity, overeating, heart defects, self-injury, self-hugging, dry skin, seizures, and hyperactivity among others based on genotype. Additional studies are required to further explore the relationships between genotype and phenotype and any potential discrepancies in health care and parental attitudes toward males and females with SMS. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.","17p11.2 deletion; Gender discrepancy; Haploinsufficiency; Mental retardation; Myopia; Overgrowth; RAI1; Self-injury; Smith-Magenis syndrome","chromosome protein; protein RAI1; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; aged; article; child; chromosome analysis; clinical feature; clinical trial; female; gene deletion; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic variability; genotype phenotype correlation; heredity; human; infant; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; parental attitude; point mutation; priority journal; sex difference; Smith Magenis syndrome; systematic review; two tailed test; Abnormalities, Multiple; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17; Female; Genotype; Humans; Male; Mental Retardation; Phenotype; Point Mutation; Sex Factors; Syndrome; Transcription Factors","Elsea, S.H.; Department of Pediatrics, Department of Human Genetics, Virginia Commonwealth University, 1101 E.

Objectives: To perform a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of all psychological treatments following the guidelines of The Cochrane Collaboration. Search strategy: Systematic searches of computerised databases, hand search of the Journal of Traumatic Stress, searches of reference lists, known websites and discussion fora, and personal communication with key workers. Selection criteria: Types of studies - Any randomised controlled trial of a psychological treatment. Types of participants - Adults suffering from traumatic stress symptoms for three months or more. Types of interventions - Trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy/exposure therapy (TFCBT); stress management (SM); other therapies (supportive therapy, non-directive counselling, psychodynamic therapy and hypnotherapy); group cognitive behavioural therapy (group CBT); eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR). Types of outcomes - Severity of clinician rated traumatic stress symptoms. Secondary measures included self-reported traumatic stress symptoms, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, adverse effects and dropouts. Data collection and analysis: Data were entered using Review Manager software. Quality assessments were performed. Data were analysed for summary effects using Review Manager 4.2. Main results: Thirty-three studies were included in the review. With regards to reduction of clinician assessed PTSD symptoms measured immediately after treatment TFCBT did significantly better than waitlist/usual care (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -1.40; 95% CI, -1.89 to -0.91; 14 studies; n = 649). There was no significant difference between TFCBT and SM (SMD = -0.27; 95% CI, -0.71 to 0.16; 6 studies; n = 239). TFCBT did significantly better than other therapies (SMD = -0.81; 95% CI, -1.19 to -0.42; 3 studies; n = 120). Stress management did significantly better than waitlist/usual care (SMD = -1.14; 95% CI, -1.62 to -0.67; 3 studies; n = 86) and than other therapies (SMD = -1.22; 95% CI, -2.09 to -0.35; 1 study; n = 25). There was no significant difference between other therapies and waitlist/usual care control (SMD = -0.43; 95% CI, -0.90 to 0.04; 2 studies; n = 72). Group TFCBT was significantly better than waitlist/usual care (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI, -1.14 to -0.31). EMDR did significantly better than waitlist/usual care (SMD = -1.51; 95% CI, -1.87 to -1.15; 5 studies; n = 162). There was no significant difference between EMDR and TFCBT (SMD = 0.02; 95% CI, -0.28 to 0.31; 6 studies; n = 187). There was no significant difference between EMDR and SM (SMD = -0.35; 95% CI, -0.90 to 0.19; 2 studies; n = 53). EMDR did significantly better than other therapies (self-report) (SMD = -0.84; 95% CI, -1.21 to -0.47; 2 studies; n = 124). Authors' conclusions: There was evidence individual TFCBT, EMDR, stress management and group TFCBT are effective in the treatment of PTSD. Other non-trauma focused psychological treatments did not reduce PTSD symptoms as significantly. There was some evidence that individual TFCBT and EMDR are superior to stress management in the treatment of PTSD at between 2 and 5 months following treatment, and also that TFCBT, EMDR and stress management were more effective than other therapies. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological treatment is harmful. There was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. The considerable unexplained heterogeneity observed in these comparisons, and the potential impact of publication bias on these data, suggest the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review.

The development of what works programs has provided a model for the evaluation of the effectiveness of current criminal justice interventions on the basis of research evidence. More recently, it has also become necessary to evaluate programs based on their relative costs and benefits, providing information not only on what works with which offenders, but also at what cost and with what benefits. Evaluating the cost of criminal justice programs is not new to the criminal justice field, since virtually all programs require the support of a funding agency that is likely to request budget information. Government agencies routinely report on annual expenditures on police, courts, prisons, and various program interventions. Until recently, however, there have been few attempts to ask the related question of what these programs are actually buying in terms of crime control or public safety. Such analyses are termed cost-effectiveness studies since they ask how much crime reduction (or other social benefit) is obtained per dollar spent. Even fewer studies have gone beyond this question to ask whether the benefits of the program exceed its costs, that is, by conducting a cost-benefit study. The differences between cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses are not well understood. One such definition provided by Barnett and Escobar (1990) suggests that cost-effectiveness is an incomplete form of cost-benefit analysis because it fails to assign monetary values to the outcomes involved (i.e., benefits and/or dis-benefits), but focuses only on the costs (resources) used. A cost-effectiveness study provides information on the cost of X dollars needed to prevent Y crimes. A cost-benefit analysis evaluates both the costs and benefits of a program or intervention, providing a complete analysis of a program or sentencing option in terms of monetary tangible and intangible costs and benefits. The product of such an analysis is a benefit-cost ratio, which provides a single measurement of the monetary benefit derived from one monetary dollar. This is a much more sensitive measure of benefit than simple reconviction data, as it takes into account levels of seriousness of the offense, numbers of offenses in a time period, and in particular takes a victim perspective in terms of costs of an offense to the victim, both tangible and intangible. When these factors are related to the amount of resource required to achieve the benefits of crime averted, the benefit-cost ratio becomes a very powerful measure. To date, very few studies have attempted to systematically review the literature on the economic costs and benefits of crime control programs. One exception is the recent review conducted by Welsh and Farrington (2000), which examined correctional interventions such as drug treatment, educational programs, and other forms of interventions in the context of corrections. The authors identified only seven published studies that met the criteria of their review. One reason that so few cost-benefit studies have been conducted is the dearth of evidence on the cost of crime, as endured by victims. Tangible costs for victims may be their outof- pocket losses, such as medical costs or lost wages; however, the largest component of victim costs is the intangible losses such as pain, suffering, and lost quality of life. More recently, there has been a growing body of literature attempting to fill in that gap by estimating intangible losses. While conducting the current systematic review of the costs and benefits of sentencing, it became evident that there was a need for an economic scale against which to measure the quality of the cost-benefit methodologies applied to the studies. A new rating scale, the Cost-Benefit Validity Scale (Cohen et al., 2002) has therefore been developed to assess the quality of cost-benefit studies and to assist future researchers in structuring their studies so that a valid benefit-cost ratio can be estimated. The Cost-Benefit Validity Scale (see Figure 1) was developed using an approach similar to the University of Maryland Scientific Methods Scale (SMS; Sherman et al., 1997). The purpose of the scale is to measure the extent to which the methodology employed in a cost-benefit study is sufficiently comprehensive for conclusions to be drawn about a programs costs and benefits. A higher score on the Cost-Benefit Validity Scale indicates that the cost and benefit information is generally of higher quality and can be used for more policy analysis purposes than a lower number. © 2006 Springer.",,,"University of York, York, United Kingdom",,"Springer Netherlands",,1402042434; 9781402042430,,,"English","Preventing Crime: What Wk. for Children, Offenders, Victims, and Places",Book Chapter,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892293351

The effects of mental practice in stroke rehabilitation: a systematic review. Objective: To assess the effects of a mental practice intervention on recovery in stroke patients. Data Sources: A systematic literature search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, Pedro, Rehadat, and RehabTrials was performed by 2 researchers independently. Eligible studies published through August 2005 were selected. Study Selection: Four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 1 controlled clinical trial (CCT), 2 patient series, and 3 case reports that investigated the effects of a mental practice intervention on recovery of stroke patients were included. Data Extraction: The selected RCTs and CCT were assessed on a methodologic quality rating scale. Important characteristics and outcomes were extracted and summarized. Results and characteristics from the patient series and case reports were only provided if they added information. Data Synthesis: Included studies differed clearly from one another with regard to patient characteristics, intervention protocol, and outcome measures. Four different mental practice strategies were used. Most tasks involved mentally rehearsing movements of the arm. Intervention periods varied from 2 to 6 weeks, frequencies ranged from multiple sessions per day to 3 times a week. Studies were limited in size. Power could not be increased by pooling or meta-analysis because studies were not comparable. Three of the 4 RCTs were of reasonable methodologic quality. There was some evidence that mental practice as an additional therapy intervention had positive effects on recovery of arm function after stroke. Two mental practice techniques appeared to be effective-tape instruction and self-regulation. Results from the single case studies indicate that mental practice is also promising for improvement of leg function. Conclusions: No definite conclusions could be drawn except that further research, using clear definitions of the content of mental practice and standardized measurement of outcome, are needed. © 2006 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.","Activities of daily living; Imagery (psychotherapy); Quality of life; Rehabilitation; Review [publication type]; Stroke","arm movement; article; autoregulation; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; data base; demography; human; mental health; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; stroke; stroke patient; systematic review; Activities of Daily Living; Cerebrovascular Accident; Clinical Trials; Humans; Imagery (Psychotherapy); Mental Processes; Motor Skills; Quality of Life; Recovery of Function","Braun, S.M.; Centre of Expertise in Life Sciences, Centre of Expertise Autonomy and Participation, School of Professional Education, Heerlen, Netherlands; email: s.braun@hszuyd.nl",,,00039993,,APMHA,"16731221","English","Arch.

Systemic Lupus Erythematousus (SLE), an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology manifesting as a pleomorphic systemic disease, affects mostly females, (female:male ratio 9:1). Clinical differences between genders, including a higher death rate in males, has been reported. Here we compared clinical manifestations and the 5-year survival probability in Mexican male and female crossbred cases living under similar socioeconomic conditions. A systematic review of published literature was also carried out. Material and Methods. SLE patients treated at the Instituto Nacional de Cardiología ""Ignacio Chávez"" México City who fulfilled at least four classification criteria (ACR) were included. The frequency of clinical variables with emphasis on cardiovascular findings before and after the diagnosis were described, disease activity based on a validated scale (SLEDAI) was determined, and the 5-year survival rate was estimated. Results. There were 33 men and 158 women, average age of 31 in both groups rangingfrom 7 to 65 and from 10 to 75 year in male and female patients respectively; both groups were followed for 3.8 years (median), average activity was of 12 points with a range of 5 to 23 in men, and 11 with a range of 2 to 24 in women. Main clinical characteristics in men were: discoid lupus, psychosis, pericarditis, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and SLE kidney disease. Immunological tests showed gender-linked differences in regard auto-antibodies (U1-nRNP, Sm, anticardiolipine and false VDRL) and hypocomplementemia. Cardiovascular features and survival rate were not different between gender. Conclusion. Male Mexican SLE patients share clinical findings with other male SLE cases reported everywhere as can be deducted from systematic literature review covering 25-year. © Copyright Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology 2004.","Ethnicity; Gender difference; Male disease; Survival rate and systematic literature review; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)","autoantibody; cardiolipin antibody; ribonucleoprotein antibody; adult; aged; autoimmune disease; cardiovascular disease; clinical feature; controlled study; discoid lupus erythematosus; disease activity; disease classification; female; frequency analysis; human; hypocomplementemia; immunoassay; lupus erythematosus nephritis; lymphocytopenia; major clinical study; male; medical literature; Mexico; mortality; pericarditis; priority journal; probability; psychosis; rating scale; review; school child; sex difference; socioeconomics; survival rate; survival time; systematic review; systemic disease; systemic lupus erythematosus; thrombocytopenia; validation process; venereal disease reaction test; Female; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Mexico; Sex Distribution; Survival Rate","Reyes, P.A.; Inst.

The procedures for evaluation of the scientific literature are described separately (Acta Oncol 2003; 42: 357-365). This synthesis of the literature on radiation therapy for skeletal metastases is based on data from 16 randomized trials. Moreover, data from 20 prospective studies, 5 retrospective studies and 22 other articles were used. A total of 63 scientific articles are included, involving 8 051 patients. The results were compared with those of a similar overview from 1996 including 13 054 patients. The conclusions reached can be summarized as follows: - Irradiation of skeletal metastases is, with few exceptions, a palliative treatment. - There is strong evidence that radiotherapy of skeletal metastases gives an overall (complete and partial pain relief) in more than 80% of patients. - There is strong evidence that the duration of pain relief in at least 50% of patients lasts for ≥ 6 months. - There is convincing evidence that pain relief, in terms of degree and duration, does not depend on the fractionation schedules applied. - Irrespective of the fractionation schedule used at irradiation, the number of later complications, such as spinal cord compression or pathological fractures, at the index fields are low. - There are some data showing that the difference in cost between single and multifraction treatment is small. However, these data do not permit any firm conclusions to be drawn. - Several reports indicate that early diagnosis and early therapy of spinal cord compression are the two most important predictors of a favourable clinical outcome after radiotherapy. However, no controlled studies have been undertaken. - When the diagnosis of spinal cord compression is late, a favourable outcome might depend on the radio-responsiveness of the tumour. The documentation is weak and no conclusions can be drawn. - There is some evidence that a small proportion of totally paralytic patients can regain walking function after radiotherapy. - There is strong evidence that the radionuclides 89Sr and 153Sm are efficient when they are used as a systemic treatment of generalized bone pain due to metastasis from carcinomas of the prostate and breast. Overall bone pain relief occurs in about 60-80% of patients with a median response duration of 2-4 months. - There is strong evidence that intravenous treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with myeloma and osteolytic bone metastasis due to carcinoma of the breast significantly decreases the number of skeleton-related events and bone pain.",,"Bone; Diagnosis; Radiotherapy; Tumors; Skeletal metastases; Oncology; bisphosphonic acid derivative; lexidronam; lexidronam samarium sm 153; pamidronic acid; strontium 89; zoledronic acid; bone lesion; bone metastasis; bone pain; breast carcinoma; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; disease duration; fatigue; fracture; health care cost; human; myeloma; priority journal; prostate carcinoma; radiation dose fractionation; review; side effect; spinal cord compression; vomiting; walking; Adult; Aged; Bone Neoplasms; Brachytherapy; Dose Fractionation; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms, Unknown Primary; Palliative Care; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Randomized Controlled Trials; Risk Assessment; Survival Analysis; Sweden; Treatment Outcome","Falkmer, U.; Department of Oncology, University Hospital, Olav Kyrres gate 17, NO-7030 Trondheim, Norway; email: ursula.falkmer@medisin.ntnu.no",,,0284186X,,ACTOE,"14596519","English","Acta Oncol.",Review,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141636523

However, existing research still considers it as a challenge to publish DS contributions in top IS journals, due to the rather strict guidelines that DS publications are expected to follow. Against this backdrop, we intend to emphasize the myriad of configurations and empirically describe the status-quo of DS publications in IS. Based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and a conceptually derived analysis frame, we empirically analyze DS papers published in the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket. Thereby, we intend to contribute conceptually and descriptively to the knowledge base of DS, by providing insights based on empirical evidence to aid and guide the discussion towards the advancement of the field. Overall, this shall lay the descriptive foundation for creating prescriptive knowledge on DS in IS by proposing and opening future research avenues. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.
