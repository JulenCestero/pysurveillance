Unfortunately, there were too many software risks involved in software engineering projects. Thus, it took a lot of time to investigate all the software risks that potentially occur in the project. Most of the project managers were only aware about the software risks when the software risk has occurred during the project. Therefore, an overview to visualize and prioritize software risks using sensitivity analysis need to be developed to help project managers determine software risks that has occurred in software engineering projects. This study adopts Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the methodology to identify the software risks that have occurred in the project and a web-based integrated with risk sensitivity analysis approach to visualize and prioritize the software risks. The study suggests that a web-based application integrated with risk sensitivity analysis can be an alternative technique to assist project managers to identify high potential software risks that might occur in software engineering projects. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

The execution of agile practices in Global Software Development (GSD) is more complex than collocated environment (single site development). The objectives of this study is to explore the factors which positively and negatively impact on scaling program of agile development in the GSD context and propose a framework based on the factors for successful scaling of agile programs in GSD context. This study is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol was adopted to investigate the factors. In the second stage, the SWOT analytical framework was followed to classify the factors into four categories: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. In the SWOT framework, the factors in strengths and weaknesses categories represent the internal aspects of the organizations while the opportunities and threats categories indicate the external aspects of organization. The findings of this study reported 24 factors. The identified 13 factors positively and 11 factors negatively impact on scaling program of agile development respectively. Moreover, a framework based on SWOT analysis is proposed that provided the classification of factors into four categories. Based on the research outcomes, we can conclude that the identified factors and their classification intoSWOT categories provide a robust framework that will assist the agile practitioners for successfully scale agile development in the GSD organizations. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Agile development; Global software development; Scaling; SWOT","Computer applications; Computer programming; Agile development; Distributed environments; Global software development; Project development; Scaling; Software organization; SWOT; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450375948,,,"English","ACM Int.

Nowadays, technology is able to support business need by extracting massive amount of data and recognizing its pattern to predict future trends. It brings right insight in business strategy to gain tremendous benefit. Hadoop is a reliable technology which developed to distribute process and storage on big data efficiently. However, Hadoop doesn't have any built-in provision to encrypt data by default. Hadoop additional feature in encryption zone has security issue which key management does outside of HDFS. Sensitive and confidential data in HDFS can be exposed against security attack. Information security is fundamental concern and new set challenge for the world of big data. The main purpose of this paper is to protect Hadoop Distributed File System data by using encryption algorithm. This is to ensure data is secured at storage level of HDFS. Dealing with big data, it is important to choose fast enough encryption algorithm that has great performance.

Special maintainability assurance techniques have been proposed for service- and microservice-based systems, but it is difficult to get a comprehensive overview of this publication landscape. We therefore conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to collect and categorize maintainability assurance approaches for service-oriented architecture (SOA) and microservices. Our search strategy led to the selection of 223 primary studies from 2007 to 2018 which we categorized with a threefold taxonomy: a) architectural (SOA, microservices, both), b) methodical (method or contribution of the study), and c) thematic (maintainability assurance subfield). We discuss the distribution among these categories and present different research directions as well as exemplary studies per thematic category. The primary finding of our SLR is that, while very few approaches have been suggested for microservices so far (24 of 223, ∼11%), we identified several thematic categories where existing SOA techniques could be adapted for the maintainability assurance of microservices. © Justus Bogner, Adrian Weller, Stefan Wagner, and Alfred Zimmermann; licensed under Creative Commons License CC-BY Joint Post-proceedings of the First and Second International Conference on Microservices (Microservices 2017/2019).","And phrases Maintainability; Microservices; Quality Assurance; Service-Based Systems; SOA; Software Evolution; Systematic Literature Review","Information services; Maintainability; Quality assurance; Software quality; Change impact analysis; Microservices; Search strategies; Service-based systems; Software Evolution; Sustainable softwares; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,"Cruz-Filipe L.Giallorenzo S.Giallorenzo S.Montesi F.Peressotti M.Rademacher F.Sachweh S.","Schloss Dagstuhl- Leibniz-Zentrum fur Informatik GmbH, Dagstuhl Publishing",21906807,9783959771375,,,"English","OpenAccess Ser.

Integrated statistical activities require a process of statistical activities that does not silo thinking. This silo thinking can be detrimental to BPS-Statistics Indonesia, especially in terms of overcoming the problem of statistical activities that have actually occurred in previous statistical activities. From these problems it is necessary to identify important knowledge that is useful to be able to be accessed and used as a lesson learned by other statistical activities. In Knowledge Management there is a tool to help identify important knowledge, namely Knowledge Map, which is assisted by analysis using the Social Network Analysis (SNA) technique. To solve the problem, BPS-Statistics Indonesia needs to conduct a study on the application of this knowledge maps with SNA technique. In this study, a study literature on knowledge maps with SNA was carried out. This literature study is in the form of Systematic Literature Review (SLR). From this literature study, an overview of the fields used as research subjects on knowledge maps with SNA, description of objectives and research suggestions currently used by researchers. This study found that the most used fields of research were non-business fields, especially in the fields of education and research. Findings regarding the purpose of the study are divided into making a design / framework or analyzing a problem. From the synthesis of SLR papers it was found that research on Knowledge Map with SNA, the purpose mostly to analyzing a problem. In this study it was also found that the suggestions for most subsequent research were suggestions for modification or refinement of research methods on knowledge maps with SNA. From these findings, BPS-Statistics Indonesia is expected to be able to take advantage and can make this literature study as the basis for the implementation of knowledge maps with SNA to solve the problem of silo thinking. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Education and researches; Government institutions; International standards; Literature reviews; Literature studies; Research subjects; Statistical datas; Systematic literature review (SLR); Statistics",,"Alfarisi S.Rahim R.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17426588,,,,"English","J.

Although devices have internet connectivity, some devices have battery limited energy. Therefore, it is important the conducting of evaluations to investigate, compare and propose security mechanisms with energy-efficient. However, there is a very low number of research using practical evaluations with real devices, as measurement approach takes a long time to perform the experiments. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze, categorize analytically and statistically the methodologies which have been presented in the area of IoT based on the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method, in order to extract features of the research protocols (definition of a set of equipment, topology, traffic, parameters, metrics and other variables) to be used in new research that addresses the concepts of security, energy and IoT. The weaknesses and highlighting of each study is discussed as well as presenting some hints for addressing future research with lower execution times of experiments, as it will be possible to reuse the results of measurements already published for the same parameter and metrics. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"Energy efficiency; Network security; Energy efficient; Internet connectivity; Internet of thing (IOT); Limited energies; Research protocol; Security mechanism; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Internet of things","Oliveira, L.P.; IFPB Campus João Pessoa, Av.

A typical embedded system project involves multi-domain experts such as business unit, software developers, hardware engineers and firmware developers. Agile methods have been successfully adopted in software engineering in general, and more recently in embedded safety critical development. A previous systematic literature review (SLR), conducted as part of this research, reported that one of the challenges of embedded safety-critical software development is multi-domain stakeholder communication. Additionally, suitable agile practices which have been used in embedded safety critical domains have been investigated. This earlier work proposed a process using a combination of suitable agile practices to support multi-domain stakeholder communication. In order to validate this proposed process, an expert review has been conducted. This paper outlines the proposed process and the findings of the expert validation.

The approaches proposed are almost never based on the existing ones and their validation is often performed in a very limited number of projects. For this reasons, practitioners are confused and find difficult to apply such approaches in their projects. Goals: This paper investigates the available techniques for evaluating TD using automated tools aiming at helping practitioners and researcher in understanding the available options and apply them correctly. Method: The study has been performed as a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) applied to 835 studies obtained from the three largest digital libraries and databases. Results: After applying all filtering stages, 38 papers out of 835 have been selected and analyzed in depth. Almost all of them propose novel approaches to measure TD using different criteria and they do not extend or validate existing approaches. Conclusions: The area is not mature and it lacks independent evaluations of the models proposed. Authors focus on proposing new approaches and no consolidation can be identified. Moreover, almost all the approaches proposed are automated only partially and through prototype tools designed just to support the studies analyzed in the paper in which the approach is proposed and rarely maintained. These facts makes difficult the application of such methods by practitioners. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Literature review; Measurement; Technical debt; Tools","Digital libraries; Information systems; Information use; Measurement; Tools; Automated tools; Literature reviews; New approaches; Prototype tools; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technical debts; Automation","Sillitti, A.; Innopolis UniversityRussian Federation; email: a.sillitti@innopolis.ru","Filipe J.Smialek M.Brodsky A.Hammoudi S.","Springer",18651348,9783030407827,,,"English","Lect.

The techniques for RA can be selected according to data type and data availability. On balance, semi-quantitative RA techniques seem to be a good compromise in risk estimation. For applying these techniques, it is necessary to build the hierarchy scale of Probability, Severity and Risk Index. The Fuzzy Logic (FL) approach is useful when dealing quantitatively with imprecision and has been applied in a wide range of fields, being a valuable tool for professionals who deal with Human Factors and human contingencies, and relevant in both RA and decision-making process of which workers’ safety and health rely on. This work aims at evidencing the pertinence of the use of FL theory to semi-quantitative RA techniques by a systematic literature review (SLR). The early results highlight the pertinence of the use of FL approach to analyze RA and the need for continuity. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Collaborative qualitative analysis; Fuzzy logic theory; Risk assessment; Risk management; Safety","Errors; Fuzzy logic; Human engineering; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Data availability; Decision making process; Fuzzy techniques; Informed decision; Occupational safety; Risk estimation; Safety and healths; Systematic literature review (SLR); Occupational risks","Leão, C.P.; ALGORITMI Centre, Department of Production and System, School of Engineering, University of MinhoPortugal; email: cpl@dps.uminho.pt","Arezes P.M.Boring R.L.","Springer",21945357,9783030509453,,,"English","Adv.

As such, the South African government has shown its commitment towards citizenry and the provision of effective service delivery. Social Media Analytics (SMA) has emerged as a potential new solution to support decision-making for service delivery in CzRM. It is believed that the demand for SMA adoption will increasingly rise. However, the reality of social media Big Data comes with the challenges of analysing it in a way that brings Big Value. The purpose of this paper is to identify the challenges of social media Big Data Analytics (BDA) and to incorporate these in a conceptual model that can be used by governments to support the e-participation of citizens. The model was developed through a systematic literature review (SLR). The findings revealed that data challenges relate to designing an optimal architecture for analysing data that caters for both historic data and real-time data at the same time. The paper highlight that process challenges relate to all the activities in the data lifecycle such as data acquisition and warehousing; data mining and cleaning; data aggregation and integration; analysis and modelling; and data interpretation.

The application of AP in agriculture can reduce time spent in manual activities, avoid the indiscriminate use of chemicals, increase production costs, soil deterioration and environmental pollution. Nowadays, AP is a booming area that, taking advantage of technological advances, in computer vision, heterogeneous architectures (Multicore, GPU, FGPA) and artificial intelligence techniques (Machine learning, Deep learning), has allowed to systematize a variety of agricultural activities, such as disease detection, plant counting, and identification of weed, pests and insects in different crops. This paper presents a systematic review of literature (SRL) of image analysis and processing techniques applied in precision agriculture using heterogeneous technologies. Therefore, 32 scientific articles of the last five years from four relevant bibliographic databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Xplore, SpringerLink) were analyzed and synthesized. The selected publications answer to four research questions proposed in this study. From the obtained results, great opportunities for image analysis (segmentation), machine learning and the use of graphic accelerators (GPU) were identified, which stand out as promising techniques and tools for the development of efficient and precise automatic systems, with the perspective to its application in real time for many agricultural tasks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","FPGA; GPU; Heterogeneous architectures; Image analysis; Multicore; Precision agriculture; SLR","Decision making; Deep learning; Deterioration; Engineering education; Environmental technology; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Graphics processing unit; Image segmentation; Information services; Machine learning; Precision agriculture; Real time systems; Agricultural activities; Artificial intelligence techniques; Environmental pollutions; Heterogeneous architectures; Heterogeneous technology; Information and Communication Technologies; Multi core; Systematic literature review; Image analysis","Pusdá-Chulde, M.R.; Faculty of Engineering in Applied Sciences, Universidad Técnica del NorteEcuador; email: mrpusda@utn.edu.ec","Nummenmaa J.Perez-Gonzalez F.Domenech-Lega B.Vaunat J.Oscar Fernandez-Pena F.","Springer",21945357,9783030336134,,,"English","Adv.

The most-reported problem in requirement engineering (RE) is the difficulty to identify quality requirements. Sometime analysts may face incorrect and incomplete requirements, which may become the reason for project failures from the perspective of dissatisfaction of stakeholders. Hence, the quality in each phase of RE is important. The main focus of this article is to categorizing, Identifying, and synthesizing the existing researches on quality enhancement of the RE process. The systematically reviewing the relevant studies based on the Kitchenham systematic review methodology is the main objective of this study. This review identifies the methods which are used for enhancing the quality of RE by improving requirement elicitation, requirement analysis and specification, and requirement validation process. In this research, we are not specific to any phase of RE. Hence, the techniques obtained for quality enhancement purpose can target different phases as we are going to deal with the overall quality of requirements to enhance different quality factors as defined by IEEE standards.

Due to the rapid increase in the human demand of wireless networks worldwide. It required efficiency for the current generation, IEEE introduced the 802.11e standard for quality of service in 2005. This standard based on the EDCA mechanism for different priority traffic to provide QoS in WLANs. Nowadays EDCA is still one of the most important techniques of channel access for providing quality of service in the latest standards of IEEE for WLANs (802.11a, 802.11ax). EDCA based on four different traffic priorities (Voice, Video, Best effort, Background). The main contribution of this research is to systematically review researches on QoS enhancement of wireless LAN. This study Identifying, categorizing, and synthesizing the appropriate researches based on Kitchenham's systematic review methodology. This review identifies the methods which are used for improving the QoS of WLAN. We also focused on the issues as contention window adjustment and channel sensing which causes a lot of collision in EDCA. There are also fairness issues between low and high priority traffic which cause starvation. Preliminary results have been reported by answering 2 selected research Questions. 30 studies were selected out of the initial set of 55 research articles. Studies answering selected research questions have been included in this report. © 2019 IEEE.","Contention Window(CW); Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA); Fairness; IEEE 802.11e; Medium Access Control (MAC); Quality of Service (QoS); Starvation; Systematic Literature Review (SLR); WLAN","IEEE Standards; Medium access control; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Contention window; Enhanced distributed channel access; Fairness; IEEE802.11E; Medium access control(MAC); Starvation; Systematic literature review (SLR); WLAN; Quality of service",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728149561,,,"English","MACS - Int.

This triggers a variety of innovations in the application layer. However, these developments cannot be followed by network layers that tend to be slow. The concept of Software Defined network is present to solve the problem. Various studies were conducted for SDN technology, one of them is security. The highlight in security is the security architecture. Many security systems that are created do not refer to the security architecture so it is difficult in its development. In addition, the current security architecture does not refer to the guidelines for the creation of security architectures according to [1] there are two parts of security zones and security layers so that only 8% of security architectures meet both sections. In this study, a survey was conducted to find out the development trend in SDN security and security architecture of SDN using systematic literature review (SLR) method, and SLR result stated that research in architecture of network security is still very relevant to be done. By knowing the guidelines for making security architecture, it is hoped that the security architecture that is designed can be the foundation of the development of security framework and security system that will be developed. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Security; Software Defined Network; Systematic literature review","Network architecture; Network layers; Security systems; Software defined networking; Architecture of networks; Development trends; Internet technology; Security; Security Architecture; Security frameworks; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Network security",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450371803,,,"English","ACM Int.

However, humanity is facing various complex barriers contributing risk to societies, for instance, lack of sustainable software engineering practices, tools, and methodologies. As a software engineer, one can support and contribute to sustainability by developing sustainable software products through sustainable practices along with managing economic, environmental, social, technical and individual dimensions of sustainability. Software engineering with sustainable practices allows for the development of sustainable software. Sustainability concerning economic, environmental, technical and social dimensions have been well explored in literature but individual sustainability dimensions need insight from researchers. Therefore, there is a need to research from an individual sustainability perspective, so this study presents the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol to identify the individual sustainability barriers along with their mitigation strategies.

To meet the stringent needs of safety standards such as ISO 26262 there is a need for efficient quantitative evaluation of the perceived information. However, to use typical methods of evaluation, such as comparing using annotated data, is not scalable due to the manual effort involved. There is thus a need to automate the process of data annotation. This paper focuses on the LiDAR sensor and aims to identify the limitations of the sensor and provides a methodology to generate annotated data of a measurable quality. The limitations with the sensor are analysed in a Systematic Literature Review on available academic texts and refined by unstructured interviews with experts.

The process is deeply dependent on interactions among the workforce (reviewer, and author) involved in process activities. Interactions among the MCR workforce are roots of various individual, social and personnel factors influencing the MCR process. Multiple research has been performed based on data analysis collected from review tools, surveys, and interviews at a single company concerning factors affecting MCR. However, MCR research is lacking systematized study concerning individual, social and personnel factors influencing the MCR process. Therefore, this study performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify individual, social and personnel factors influencing the MCR process.

We investigated the relevant studies, compared and integrated our results with the two previous higher education studies. Therefore, 67 articles were identified, which we classified in two main areas of research: a) The use of the specification and its standards; b) The development of systems of authorship, management and execution of LD. From these 67, only 8 achieved the minimum quality requirements established and were considered relevant for the scenario of this research. Finally, our results allow us to see that the SLR as a research method has been less adopt in the LD research community.

As a result, it can lead to more active participation of citizens in government programs. However, there are many cases of e-government that are lack of citizens' involvement. To address this problem, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with Kitchenham method on gamification in e- government was employed. It analyzed lesson learned from gamification in e-government, which was implemented in 8 countries in Asia, Europe, America and Australia. The results show that citizens prefer accepting rewards such as money, better feeling, digital badges, and certificates of appreciation to take part in e-government. These findings become inputs for further study to develop a protype of gamification for e- government in Indonesia. © 2019 IEEE.","citizens' participation; e-government; gamification; systematic literature review","Gamification; Australia; citizens' participation; E-govemment; Government projects; Indonesia; Social interactions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); e-government",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728122076,,,"English","Proc.

One such problem is identifying and classifying software requirements on Stack Overflow (SO). The suitability of ML-based techniques to this tackle problem has shown convincing results, much better than those generated by some traditional natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Nevertheless, a comprehensive and systematic comprehension of these ML based techniques is still deficient. Objective: To identify and classify the type of ML algorithms used for identifying software requirements on SO. Method: This article reports systematic literature review (SLR) gathering evidence published up to August, 2019. Results: This study identified 1073 published papers related to RE and SO. Only 12 primary papers were selected. The data extraction process revealed that; 1) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling is the most widely used ML algorithm in the selected studies, and 2) Precision and recall are the most commonly used evaluation method to measure the performance of these ML algorithms. Conclusion: The SLR finds that while ML algorithms have great potential in the identification of RE on SO, they face some open issues that will ultimately affect their performance and practical application. The SLR calls for the collaboration between RE and ML researchers, to tackle the open issues facing the development of real-world ML systems. © 2019 IEEE.","Algorithms; Machine learning; Requirements engineering; Stack overflow; Systematic literature review","Algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; Statistics; Empirical evaluations; Latent dirichlet allocations; NAtural language processing; Precision and recall; Software requirements; Stack overflow; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Learning algorithms",,"Li W.Babu M.S.P.","IEEE Computer Society",23270586,9781728109459,,,"English","Proc.IEEE Int.

The areas of climate change, biodiversity loss, nitrogen cycle and land use have left the so called safe operating space for humanity. The built environment is one of the major contributors to environmental impacts. Especially the embodied energy during the construction phase of the built environment and the energy demands during the use of buildings contribute to a high energy and resource consumption. In the year 2015 the United Nations adopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a universal development agenda, which goals need to be fulfilled by the year 2030 and by all UN countries worldwide. Amongst other countries Austria has adopted the 2030 agenda and has committed itself to the SDGs. Research objective was to explore the application of systemic approaches in the field of SDGs. The work presents a systematic literature review (SLR) and discusses an application of a qualitative system analysis (carried out with the tool iMODELER) on the SDGs. Results show how interdependencies among SDGs and among chosen concrete actions, e.g. for the built environment, can be visualized for a better systemic understanding.

One of the sources of GL refers to content produced by professionals based on their practical experiences? Recent researches in the SE states that GL can complement areas of research that are not yet clearly defined in the scientific literature. In this context, the Multivocal Literature Review (MLR), a form of Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with the inclusion of GL, emerges. Goal: Provide preliminary work about the current research involving MLR studies? First, we investigate the motivation of the researchers to include GL in review studies; and second, we examine how GL was included in the studies. Method: A tertiary study was conducted to search MLR studies published between 2009 to April of 2019. Results: The main motivations for including GL in review studies are: lack of academic research on the topic, emerging research on this topic, and complementary evidence in the GL? Internet articles and white papers were the main sources of GL data used. Conclusions: The conducting of MLR studies is still in its early stages; we have identified only 12 secondary studies. The MLR studies were conducted using guidelines for performing SLRs. What we consider to be a threat to the validity of these studies, since guidelines to conduct SLR studies do not provide recommendations for quality analysis and synthesis of primary studies, including GL. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Motivation; Software engineering; Academic research; Analysis and synthesis; Grey literature; Literature reviews; Practical experience; Recent researches; Scientific literature; Systematic literature review (SLR); Engineering research",,,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,9781728129686,,,"English","Int.

This has motivated a lot of research focused on automating the process. Current state-of-the-art methods combine active learning methods and manual selection of primary studies from a smaller set so they can maximize the finding of relevant papers while at the same time minimizing the number of manually reviewed papers. In this work, we propose a novel strategy to further improve these methods whose early success heavily depends on an effective selection of initial papers to be read by researchers using a PCAbased method which combines different document representation and similarity metric approaches to cluster and rank the content within the corpus related to an enriched representation of research questions within the SLR protocol. Validation was carried out over four publicly available data sets corresponding to SLR studies from the Software Engineering domain. The proposed model proved to be more efficient than a BM25 baseline model as a mechanism to select the initial set of relevant primary studies within the top 100 rank, which makes it a promising method to bootstrap an active learning cycle. © 2019 IEEE.","automation; data mining; knowledge graphs; machinelearning; NLP; PCA; ranking indexing; Systematic literature review; text mining",,,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728155746,,,"English","Proc. - Lat.

Many of these SLRs are now outdated, and there are no standard proposals on how to update SLRs in SE. [Objective] The goal of this paper is to provide recommendations on how to best to search for evidence when updating SLRs in SE. [Method] To achieve our goal, we compare and discuss outcomes from applying different search strategies to identifying primary studies in a previously published SLR update on effort estimation. [Results] The use of a single iteration forward snowballing with Google Scholar, and employing the original SLR and its primary studies as a seed set seems to be the most cost-effective way to search for new evidence when updating SLRs.

They are valuable tools to support the quantitative analysis of the behavior of different types of projects because they allow the use of different techniques such as stochastic and analytical methods to evaluate the impact of project decisions without the real execution costs. Recently, in silico studies have been used to study distributed software development projects. In this paper, we present a simulation model defined by a set of variables that describe the dynamics of Distributed Software Development (DSD) projects. The assessment of our simulation model is based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) where we seek evidence, from primary studies published until October 2018, that the variables and relationships in our model do exist in actual DSD projects. We use a SLR as a validation mechanism. Our results are twofold. First, there is a gap of studies on some variables including knowledge expertise and task allocation strategy in distributed software development projects. And, second, there still is a lack of data to support results related to productivity, especially testing activities, on DSD projects. Despite the problem of lack of common terminology for reporting the results on DSD studies, we argue that we need more studies to be able to clearly infer the dynamics of the relationship between variables on distributed software development. Our study brings one step closer to fulfill this gap. © 2019 IEEE.","Distributed Software Development; In Silico Studies; Literature Review; Process Simulation","Application programs; Stochastic systems; Analytical method; Distributed software; Distributed software development; In-silico; Literature reviews; Process simulations; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,"Staron M.Capilla R.Skavhaug A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728132853,,,"English","Proc. - Euromicro Conf.

However, another problem with e-learning, which is lack of student motivation, still remains. Some researchers must apply gamification in e-learning with the aim of giving participation and increasing student motivation. Characteristics of different users, the same learning content, and static gamification elements do not increase the expected motivation. To overcome this problem, gamification must be adapted to the characteristics of the learners. This study uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to analyze research components, methods, and framework used in adaptive gamification. The first step is to determine the research question (RQ) and then to search on several kinds of literature published in popular journal databases, namely IEEE Xplore, Science Direct, Scopus, Springerlink and ACM from 2011 - 2019. As a result of a review of 25 selected articles, there are four components of adaptive gamification, namely, player/learner profiles, learning style, behavior, and skill/knowledge. Meanwhile, there are eleven types of methods used in adaptive gamification. The most popular method is scoring and Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM). Generally, the proposed framework consists of three elements namely adaptive gamification engine, adaptive component, and gamification display. © 2019 IEEE.","adaptive; e-learning; gamification; SLR; systematic literature review","E-learning; Motivation; Adaptive components; Learning contents; Learning Style; Learning technology; Research questions; Student motivation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Gamification",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21556830,9781728124186,,,"English","Proceeding Int.

Research in the field of text summarization began in the 1950s and until now there is no system that can produce summaries such as professionals or humans. This paper aims to identify and analyze methods, datasets and trends in automatic text summarization research from 2015 to 2019. The method used a systematic literature review (SLR) about automatic text summarization. The results obtained are that research on automatic text summarization is still relevant to date. The extractive approach is still in demand in the past three years because the extractive is easier than abstractive and the opportunity to combine methods is still open, for example using a neuro computing approach, namely the emergence of a new DQN method (Deep Q-Network) which shows comparable results and even better. The text summarization research trend has also undergone a slight change in the past three years where new things have emerged that are trends that are leading to optimization, how to optimize text summarization performance in order to get high accuracy. © 2019 IEEE","Automatic text summarization; Dataset; Method; SLR; Trend research","Automatic machines; Automatic text summarization; Dataset; Extractive approach; Information contents; Method; Systematic literature review (SLR); Text summarization; Text processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728116556,,,"English","Int.

The communication is realized through the On-Board Unit (OBU) equipped in vehicles. The concern of VANET is to provide a safe journey to the passengers. Although its significant high mobility of vehicles may cause a loss in connection or security attacks. Objective: The aim behind systematic literature review (SLR) is to identify the diverse type of security attacks in VANET and their respective solutions to handle those attack. This study mainly focuses on VANET centric security attacks and categorizes them along with the solutions to handle these attacks. Method: By using kitchenham guideline for systematic review and PRISMA flow for study selection to ensure coverage of all relevant studies we initially came up with 403 articles. Among these studies, 84 studies were qualified to be relevant according to 4 defined research questions. After identification and categorization of VANET centric attacks, proposed solutions a mapping between attacks and solution is provided. Results: Result of this systematic literature review suggest that identifies Access Management is a major concern in VANET with 44% of selected studies followed by Privacy 28% and Sybil attack 5%. Similarly, numerous security concerns such as Message Authentication 3%, Trust Management 4% and Black Hole attack 3% receives considerably lesser attention by the research community. Conclusions: In the context of security-related solutions which technique found to be most widely used to resolve the problem. The contribution of this study is considered important because there is no such study that has provided such an extensive overview of VANET security attacks and their perspective solutions. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Authentication; Privacy; Security; Security attacks; Systematic Literature Review (SLR); Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET)","Authentication; Data privacy; Vehicular ad hoc networks; Access management; Message authentication; Research communities; Research questions; Security; Security attacks; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Network security",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450371636,,,"English","ACM Int.

It is important for librarians to know which methods of teaching engineering information literacy (EIL) are most effective for student learning, in order to make efficient and effective use of student and librarian time. Purpose/Hypothesis - The authors reviewed the existing literature to find indications of the most effective methods for teaching and/or integrating EIL, both in face-to-face and online instruction. Design/Method - The authors have completed the first stages of a systematic literature review (SLR), through the creation of the final dataset. The initial searches generated a set of 1224 papers prior to duplicate removal. Duplicate removal and multiple rounds of review, using authors-created inclusion and exclusion criteria, narrowed the final dataset to 13 papers. Scope/Method - The lessons learned in the process around searching, tools for data evaluation, and articulation of criteria are presented. As a result of this portion of the SLR process, the authors identified characteristics of the undergraduate-focused EIL literature that are shared. Results/Discussion - A brief summary of the process to arrive at a final dataset of 13 papers, the challenges in the process, and the refinements made at each step are outlined. Conclusion - There are several preliminary conclusions to be drawn, many of which will not be surprising to the engineering librarian community. The dataset came down to just 13 items because much of the EIL literature is based on student self-report data on how the class went, or was it enjoyable, rather than on actual student learning gains. As such, these papers did not meet the criteria for demonstrated learning gains as a measure of effectiveness. In addition, some papers were excluded for lack of clarity about methods. In these studies it is not evident how either the intervention and/or the assessment was conducted, with regard to timing, instrument used, etc. Some additional papers were excluded because a control or comparison group was not included to establish “effectiveness” of the intervention. Overall, the authors note the EIL literature frequently reports descriptive statistics, showing that data has been gathered, but sometimes falls short of a full analysis that allows the researchers to draw meaningful/well-grounded conclusions from the data. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019",,,,,"American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,,"English","ASEE Annu.

A main reason is the decreasing lack of predictability of markets, technologies, and customer behaviors. New approaches for product roadmapping seem to be necessary in order to cope with today's highly dynamic conditions. Little research is available with respect to such new approaches. Objective: In order to better understand the state of the art and to identify research gaps, this article presents a review of the scientific literature with respect to product roadmapping. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) with respect to identify papers in the field of computer science. Results: After filtering, the search resulted in a set of 23 relevant papers. The identified papers focus on different aspects such as roadmap types, processes for creating and updating roadmaps, problems and challenges with roadmapping, approaches to visualize roadmaps, generic frameworks and specific aspects such as the combination of roadmaps with business modeling. Overall, the scientific literature covers many important aspects of roadmapping but does provide only little knowledge on how to create product roadmaps under highly dynamic conditions. Research gaps address, for instance, the inclusion of goals or outcomes into product roadmaps, the alignment of a roadmap with a product vision, and the inclusion of product discovery activities in product roadmaps. In addition, the transformation from traditional roadmapping processes to new ways of roadmapping is not sufficiently addressed in the scientific literature. © 2019 IEEE.","agile development; product discovery; product management; product roadmap; product strategy; product vision; roadmapping","Commerce; Systems engineering; Agile development; product discovery; Product management; Product strategy; Product vision; Roadmap; Roadmapping; Engineering research",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728134017,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Software Engineering (SE) researchers have adopted a variety of methods of synthesizing data that originated in other disciplines. One of the qualitative data synthesis methods is meta-ethnography, which is being used in SE SLRs. Objective: We aim at studying the adoption of meta-ethnography in SE SLRs in order to understand how this method has been used in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study of the use of meta-ethnography by reviewing sixteen SLRs. We carried out an empirical inquiry by integrating SLR and confirmatory email survey. Results: There is a general lack of knowledge, or even awareness, of different aspects of meta-ethnography and/or how to apply it. Conclusion: There is a need of investment in gaining in-depth knowledge and skills of correctly applying meta-ethnography in order to increase the quality and reliability of the findings generated from SE SLRs. Our study reveals that meta-ethnography is a suitable method to SE research. We discuss challenges and propose recommendations of adopting meta-ethnography in SE. Our effort also offers a preliminary checklist of the systematic considerations for doing meta-ethnography in SE and improving the quality of meta-ethnographic research in SE. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Meta-ethnography; Qualitative research synthesis; Systematic (literature) review","Computer applications; Computer programming; Data synthesis; In-depth knowledge; Meta-ethnography; Qualitative data; Qualitative research; Systematic (literature) review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Tertiary study; Software engineering",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450371452,,,"English","ACM Int.

During the last decade, many studies are carried out to address these problems, however, careful examination of these works suggests that there’s a potential research gap. This paper has performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the most significant/commonly studied challenges of requirement change management process and furthermore this process under GSD context. We identified ten challenges such as impact analysis, cost estimation, artifacts documents management, requirement traceability, requirements dependency, conflicts with existing requirements, time estimation, change prioritization, user involvement, and system destabilizing. Furthermore, three challenges such as communication and coordination, knowledge sharing, management, and Change Control Board (CCB) management are identified for globally distributed projects. We also mapped these identified challenges to Requirement Change Management Process (RCMP) outcomes proposed in our previous study. We believe that mapping between RCM challenges and RCMP outcomes will enhance the practical significance of this study results. Considering the systematic literature review results, we suggest that there is a need to develop a framework for requirement change management for quality software systems development. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Global software development; Requirement change management; Requirements evolution; Systematic literature review","Cost estimating; Life cycle; Global software development; Requirement change managements; Requirement traceabilitys; Requirements dependencies; Requirements evolution; Software development life cycle; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450371452,,,"English","ACM Int.

Some of the methodologies being used in industry with time are converted in 'best practices'. This systematic literature review (SLR) focuses on finding what are the software engineering best practices being taught to students in academia. It is expected to show with this SLR what are the best practices being taught and how, so other instructors and the teaching staff can evaluate what to choose and level up their courses to the extent of what is being used and is already tested. To perform this SLR, a well-known protocol was used with the search string: 'software engineering education' and 'best practices' (variations and synonyms of the words were also used), the search was performed in six well-known databases. It is surprising that the amount of primary studies found in this SLR was not what was expected, seventeen primary studies were identified. These studies mentioned a total of seventy best practices that are being used in academia to teach software engineering, some of them are mentioned in more than one paper. But the granularity of the primary studies was quite different some of the best practices are really software engineering best practices and others are instructional best practices. It was also evaluated how the use of these practices was validated and reported, and the results are very diverse, some of them did not have a validation, others have qualitative data, and a few qualitative and quantitative data. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Software engineering; Students; Development technology; Engineering best practice; Qualitative data; Quantitative data; Software industry; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Teaching software; Engineering education",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781538611739,PFECD,,"English","Proc.

These applications are smaller in size but demand high usability interfaces so that users can interact with them. A user-friendly and highly interactive Mobile User Interface (MUI) plays a central role in successful market of a mobile application. Previously, many studies have been conducted about the design, methodologies and tools for MUI. However, up till now no research has been performed to the best of our knowledge that analyzes and summarizes the latest methods and tools in the context of MUI development. Therefore, in this paper, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is carried out to analyze 30 researches (2014-2018) in the domain of mobile user interface development. We identify 16 techniques and 12 tools. Subsequently, comparative analysis of leading techniques and tools is performed. We conclude that MobiGUITAR and MDA SMARTAPP are the leading tools for MUI development. The results and outcomes of this research are going to prove to be greatly helpful for the researchers and practitioners to adopt best practices in MUI domain. © 2018 IEEE.","Android GUIs; Graphical user interface; Mobile application usability; Mobile HCI; Mobile HMI; Mobile user interface development","Graphical user interfaces; Comparative analysis; Mobile applications; Mobile HCI; Mobile HMI; Mobile user interface; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Techniques and tools; Mobile computing",,"Chakrabarti S.Saha H.N.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538672662,,,"English","IEEE Annu.

It is essential to prioritize the requirements for making the correct decision for either a single or multiple release of a product. In this paper we performed a systematic analysis on some of the significant factors like importance of requirements, risks, cost and time in context of requirement prioritization. Objective: With benefits these prioritization methods also have some limitations and shortcoming that are brought up in this paper. Stakeholders, managers, developers or their representatives make decisions for prioritization of requirements. Many techniques are analyzed how to manage these prioritizations considering general goals and limitations. Method: For the identification and analyzing of research articles published during 2009-2017, Systematic Literature Review based method is used in this paper. Results: In recent researches 40 different requirement prioritizations techniques has been used. This SLR also shows the major research gaps regarding techniques and tools for software requirements prioritization. Conclusion: This research shows the major prioritization techniques and tools for requirements elicitation. Tools & techniques identified in this study will assist future researchers to expend their views in the context.

But, the adoption of GSD is not straightforward, there are various complications allied with it mainly that related to requirements change management (RCM). The aim of this study is to identify project administration related challenges (CHs) that could negatively impact the RCM activities in GSD firms. We have employed systematic literature review (SLR) method in order to investigate the CHs. Using the SLR method, 10 CHs were identified. The identified CHs were categorized into three broad categories based on the size of organizations as small scale organizations (SSOs), medium scale organizations (MSOs) and large scale organizations (LSOs) in the context of GSD. The classification of the CHs was used to provide a clear picture of RCM process, and their respective CHs in organization size prospective. The study also indicated the critical challenges for RCM process implementation using the standards of the factors having a frequency ≥ 50% as critical. Our findings revealed that 3 out of ten CHs are critical for the implementation of RCM process in GSD. We believe that the findings of this paper are helpful in addressing project administration related problems of RCM practitioners in GSD, which is important for the success of GSD firms. © 2018 IEEE.","'global software development (GSD)'; requirements change management (RCM); systematic literature review","Computer programming; Computer science; Electrical engineering; Mathematical techniques; Critical challenges; Global software development; Organization sizes; Process implementation; Quality software; Requirements change; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538679395,,,"English","Int.

However, e-government initiatives face several barriers. One of them is poor usability. To advance quality of usability, literatures indicate that usability evaluation is a key success factor. There are many approaches to conduct usability evaluation. Each of it has advantages and challenges. On the other hand, there are several aspects that must be considered related to usability evaluation in e-government context. It includes large stakeholders and their diversity, extra needs for ethical practices, as well as high privacy. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the right usability evaluation method in e-government. In order to address this issue, a study using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify the suitable usability evaluation methods. There are 519 literatures that have been selected in the initial stage. It was then followed by an extraction process, which produced 22 selected references.

Some studies propose a mature solution, although they do not present data that are more consistent and capable of being evaluated. Other studies are superficial. In addition, few studies have gone through the protocol. So the main conclusion is that combining SOA and Agile methods can be a good way to solve the problem, but more studies are needed. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agile methods; Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA); Software engineering; Systematic Literature Review (SLR)","Information services; Software engineering; Agile development; Agile methods; Business objectives; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Service oriented architecture (SOA)","Chaves, J.T.F.; University of Brasilia, Darcy Ribeiro CampusBrazil; email: jameschaves@gmail.com","Misra S.Gervasi O.Murgante B.Stankova E.Korkhov V.Torre C.Tarantino E.Rocha A.M.A.C.Taniar D.Apduhan B.O.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783030243074,,,"English","Lect.

Additionally, one of the SE areas that supports quality assurance is testing. Given that specific methods, processes, and ultimately strategies for software testing involve a large number of specific concepts, it is valuable to have a robust conceptual base, that is, a testing ontology that defines the terms, properties, relationships and axioms explicitly and unambiguously. In order to look for a testing ontology that can be used in a family of testing strategies, in this paper, we investigate, by means of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), primary studies on software testing ontologies.

Healthcare is a major example of how the three Vs of data i.e., velocity, variety, and volume, are an important feature of the data it generates. In medical imaging (MI), the exact diagnosis of the disease and/or assessment of disease relies on both image collection and interpretation. Image interpretation by the human experts is a bit difficult with respect to its discrimination, the complication of the image, and also the prevalent variations exist across various analyzers.

It is a situation where the level and work skillset that are available do not match the market demands and the individual does not know how to identify the skills that they have. To deal with this problem, prediction techniques is used to assist in identifying work-appropriate skills for individual. Thus, a systematic literature review (SLR) on predicting work skillsets using prediction techniques is proposed. The aim of this study is to give an overview on the prediction techniques that have been used to predict work skillset and the accuracy of the techniques. We use SLR to identify 383 prediction techniques studies for identifying skills published from 2014 to 2019. As a result, 9 studies report adequate information and methodology according to our criteria and apply. From the studies, classification techniques are used for predicting work skillset. The algorithms used is Random Forest with precision is 99%. From this study, a future study will be conducted by developing a prediction model to help identifying appropriate work skillsets to meet current needs and identifying the levels of skills they have.

Often, people talk about TD as the amount of postponed work but this is just a basic approximation of the concept that includes many aspects that are technical and managerial. If TD is managed properly, it can provide a huge advantage but it can also make projects unmaintainable, if not. Therefore, being able of measuring TD is a very important aspect for a proper management of the development process. However, due to the complexity of the concept and the different aspects that are involved, such measurement it not easy and there are several different approaches in literature. Goals: This work aims at investigating the existing approaches to the measurement and the analysis of TD focusing on quantitative methods that could also be automated. Method: The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach was applied to 331 studies obtained from the three largest digital libraries and databases. Results: After applying all filtering stages, 21 papers out of 331 were selected and deeply analyzed. The majority of them suggested new approaches to measure TD using different criteria not built on top of existing ones. Conclusions: Existing studies related to the measurement of TD were observed and analyzed. The findings have shown that the field is not mature and there are several models that have almost no independent validation. Moreover few tools for helping to automate the evaluation process exist.

However, secondary studies are time-consuming and require a significant effort from researchers. Goal: This paper aims to identify contributions derived from the adoption of machine learning (ML) techniques in Computer Science SLRs. Method: We performed a systematic mapping study querying well-known repositories and first found 399 studies as a result of applying the search string in each of the selected search engines. Following the research protocol, we analyzed titles and abstracts and applied inclusion, exclusion and quality criteria to finally obtain a set of 17 studies to be further analyzed. Results: The selected papers provided evidence of relevant contributions of the machine learning usage in performing secondary studies. We found that ML techniques have not been applied yet to all the stages of a SLR. Typically, the preferred stage to apply ML in an SLR is the study selection phase (typically the initial phase). For assessing the effectiveness of ML support while performing SLRs, researchers have provided a comparison either across different ML techniques tested or between manual and ML-supported SLRs. Conclusion: There is significant evidence that the use of machine learning applied to SLR activities (especially the study selection activity) in Computer Science is feasible and promising, and the findings can be potentially extended to other research fields. Also, there is a lack of studies exploring ML techniques for other stages than study selection. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

A clear example is the analysis of cocoa beans quality. The increasing interest of computer vision in this area calls for a clear, systematic overview. In this sense, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of computer vision algorithms to determine the quality of fermented cocoa in a six-year period: from 2013–2018. The aim of this review is to identify the techniques or computer vision algorithms used to assess fermentation index of cocoa beans for quality control, as well, the main physical and chemical characteristics of the cocoa beans identified through the computer vision algorithms. The results show that the PLS (Partial Least-Squares) algorithm is the most used for the classification of images in a statistical approach. Also, color is the physical parameter that is commonly identified through artificial vision algorithms. Meanwhile, Fat and pH are the chemical parameters most identified by FT-NIR (Fourier transform near-infrared) technology in conjunction with the chemometric technique. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Computer vision; Computer vision algorithms; Image recognition","Agriculture; Cocoa; Image recognition; Infrared devices; Least squares approximations; Quality control; Chemometric techniques; Computer vision algorithms; Computer vision techniques; Fourier transform near infrared; Partial least square (PLS); Physical and chemical characteristics; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Computer vision","Mite-Baidal, K.; Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Computer Science Department, Agrarian University of Ecuador, Av. 25 de Julio y Pio Jaramillo, P.O.

People keep numerous identities on various online social sites. User-related network data has distinctive information which shows user interests, behavioral patterns, and political views. By using these behaviors individually and collectively are of great help to recognize users across social networks. SLR (Systematic Literature Review) has been performed to distinguish 31 papers published during 2010–2018. The idea is to determine user identification categories that are used to classify users. Furthermore, to identify algorithms, models, methods, and tools that has been suggested since 2010 for user characterization. We have identified 10 algorithms, 19 models, 5 methods and 8 tools that have proposed for 5 user identification categories.

To better understand how these applications can be developed for web browsers, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) composed by two searches for scientific articles, one regarding how multi-projection systems can be implemented using web browsers (which selected 10 articles), and another one regarding how interaction devices besides mouse and keyboard can be used in web browsers (which selected 26 articles); their results were then compiled under the mantle of multi-projected I3DIV applications for web browsers. Results show, among other things, that multi-projection systems for the web are most commonly implemented using client-server and decentralized graphic clusters, that diversified interaction devices are most commonly accessed in web browsers using an approach we called ""device-server-browser"", and that there is currently only one software resource that can be used to develop multi-projected I3DIV applications for web browsers, however it also has limitations regarding usage and, possibly, performance. We conclude then that there is a gap for a resource that addresses these subjects in a more appropriate way. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

However, the poor performance of supply chain management has been identified as a pivotal reason for low uptake of OSM. We believe that there are no significant reports on research that addresses the theoretical development of Housing-Offsite Manufacturing-Supply Chain Management (HOSCM). A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out to identify the critical issues related to supply chain management in HOSCM research. Around 39 journal articles spanning from 1996 to 2017 (as of October), addressing HOSCM research, were selected. Around eighty-two issues were identified after an in-depth content analysis with reference to principal component bodies of Supply Chain Management (SCM), entity of analysis, level of analysis, elements of exchange and OSM type. Identified issues were clustered under similar themes named as HOSCM constructs as weak demand, product customization, inappropriate strategy setting, stakeholder repositioning, lack of customer focus, dynamic relationships, varied stakeholder engagement, slow organizational learning, imbalance risk distribution, local environment adaptation, lack of knowledge sharing, poor communication, lack of technology utilization, financial fragility, lack of logistic integration, and inadequate performance measurement.

Recently, new studies have appeared presenting quality assurance methods (QA) for assessing the instructional design in MOOCs with pedagogical innovations, like those implementing active learning pedagogies (e.g. collaboration, gamification), which provide designers and instructors with useful strategies in order to design more interactive MOOCs. However, it is not that clear how these efforts are being addressed and up to which point are appropriate to assess active learning pedagogies. Therefore, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify the most mature existing MOOC QA methods. Afterwards, an evaluative case study was carried out, based on the Evaluand-oriented Responsive Evaluation Model (EREM), to apply the selected methods to a MOOC implementing active learning pedagogies. As the results suggest, the instruments of the selected QA methods need enrichment to assess effectively the instructional design based on active learning pedagogies, by providing specific questions proper for this kind of MOOCs or, by stating the underlying pedagogical model clearly so that the designers could consider beforehand if it is appropriate or not for their case. The results of the study are a first step to define new, enriched quality assessment methods for MOOCs that apply active learning approaches. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

However, the development of business process models from textual requirements through existing BPML’s is a time consuming task. In this context, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are commonly applied to automatically generate business process models from textual requirements. Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a well-known BPML. This article comprehensively investigates modern techniques, tools and trends for the generation of BPMN models from textual requirements by utilizing NLP techniques. Particularly, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is performed to select and evaluate 36 research studies published in the span of 2010–2018. As a result, 11 NLP and 8 BPMN tools are identified. Furthermore, 8 commonly generated BPMN constructs are recognized. Finally, a comparative analysis of NLP and BPMN tools is performed with the help of important evaluation parameters. It is concluded that the existing NLP techniques and tools significantly simplify the process of BPMN models generation from textual requirements. However, the existing approaches are inadequate to be applied in the industries, especially for real-time systems. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","BPML; BPMN; Business process model and notation; Natural language processing; NLP","Interactive computer systems; Modeling languages; Real time systems; Software design; Systems engineering; BPML; BPMN; Business process model; Business process model and notation (BPMN); Business process modeling languages; Development community; Evaluation parameters; Systematic literature review (SLR); Natural language processing systems","Maqbool, B.; Department of Computer & Software Engineering, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences and TechnologyPakistan; email: bilal.maqbool16@ce.ceme.edu.pk","Kim K.J.Kim K.J.Baek N.","Springer Verlag",18761100,9789811310553,,,"English","Lect.

Mobile devices are becoming an integral part of daily life. Nowadays it is very much difficult and tricky to use the mobile application. A task like sending data from one application to another application is too much difficult. Normal people who use these mobile applications, sometimes they feel difficult to use them. Hence, there is a clear point that visually impaired people need much more efforts to use these applications. In the past years, there are many types of research try to improve the mobile application for visually impaired people. All the mobile applications produced from these researches are focusing in technocentric approach, in which they ignore the analysis of actual needs from visually impaired people. In order to improve the quality of mobile application for visually impaired people, the UCD interfaces are more valuable. It can provide more freedom for visually impaired people to perform their daily tasks. It is really helpful for visually impaired people who access their needs with minimum physical and mental effort, and least effect on their natural activity. This paper provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the present studies on UCD interface of mobile application for visually impaired people. The first aim is to identify current problems facing by visually impaired people when using the mobile applications. The second aim is to summarize the possible solutions to resolve the problems facing by visually impaired people when using the mobile applications. The third aim is to find the problem in UCD interface of mobile application manufacturing. This research will also beneficial for future research in UCD interface of a mobile application for visually impaired people. UCD of a mobile application can bring marvelous changes in the life of visually impaired people. These interfaces and new strategies expected to improve the quality of life for visually impaired people. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Human-computer interaction; Mobile application; Systematic Literature Review; User interface; Visual impairment; Visually impair","Facings; Human computer interaction; Mobile computing; Software design; User interfaces; Mobile application development; Mobile applications; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); User Centered Design(UCD); Visual impairment; Visually impair; Visually impaired people; User centered design","Wong, D.H.-T.; Razak Faculty of Technology and Informatics, Universiti Teknologi MalaysiaMalaysia; email: doriswong@utm.my","Stephanidis C.Antona M.","Springer",18650929,9783030307110,,,"English","Commun.

ERP systems achieve this by automating and incorporating business processes and data sharing through the organisation and enabling access of information in a real-time environment. These systems mitigate the complexity and the scale of the system implementation process which can result in failures and implementation difficulties. An Information System (IS) is included as a component of an ERP system designed to provide useful information that supports business strategy, business operations, business management analysis and decision making functions. The main purpose of this study focuses on the challenges that occur prior to and post the ERP implementation process in manufacturing organizations over a period of time. The present study adopts a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach to gain a comprehensive view of the various research methods and finding, evaluating and synthesizing research. The findings for the present study reveals the lack of various elements that includes top management support, clear vision and goals, organizational culture and user training, departmental collaboration, re-alignment of strategy, project management.

As a result, manufacturers face a high variety of products, small batch sizes and frequent changeovers. To cope with these challenges, an appropriate level of flexibility of the assembly system is required. A methodology for quantifying the flexibility level of assembly workstations could help to evaluate (and improve) this flexibility level at all times. That flexibility model could even be integrated into the standard workstation design process. Despite the general consensus among researchers that manufacturing flexibility is a multi-dimensional concept, there is still no consensus on its different dimensions. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) shows that many similarities can be found in the multitude of flexibility dimensions. Through a series of interactive company workshops, we achieved to reduce them to a shortlist of 9 flexibility dimensions applicable to an assembly workstation. In addition, a first step was taken to construct a causal model of these flexibility dimensions and their determining factors, the so called drivers, through the Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) approach. In the next phase, a driver scoring mechanism will be initiated to achieve an overall assembly workstation flexibility assessment based on the scoring of drivers depending on the workstation design. © 2019 The Authors.

The research presented here is a stepping stone in order to investigating the existing building portfolio and the conducted analysis. It is used to get further information on what is included and where there is lack of information, in order to understand what is missing or what is needed to develop CE design strategies. Although, life cycle assessment (LCA) is increasingly used by the industry to assess these aspects, the lack of a systematic analytical approach as well as the high building complexity and diversity between buildings limits generalised knowledge from these studies. However, it is assumed that there are certain commonalities between the existing portfolio of prevailing building typologies which can be deducted. The study at hand is a part of a larger research project that aims at developing industry specific tools to support designers and decision makers select CE design strategies that improve the environmental performance and resource consumption of buildings. On the basis of a comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) of whole building LCAs the paper at hand aims at tracing the environmental impact origin within the existing building portfolio of prevailing building typologies. To identify potentially important building parameters relevant to the resulting environmental impact performance and resource consumption of different building typologies. Based on 39 building LCA case studies that matched the specific inclusion and exclusion criteria of the SLR a focus on global warming and climate change was detected. It was found that even though buildings have different characteristics (size, typology, storeys, reference study period and location), for most of the buildings' environmental impacts were predominantly related to the production of structurally important concrete components e.g. The structural frame, the external envelope, floor slabs and walls. To point towards which CE design strategies should be used to improve the environmental performance of buildings; the environmental information from the studies was insufficient due to lack of detailed information. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, in the digitally connected world the organisation is increasingly challenged to protect personal data and there is greater potential for inappropriate data use or disclosure, which can result in legal, financial, and reputational consequences for the organisation. Developments brought about by digital transformation increase the requirement for more stringent approaches to personal data protection to be implemented by the organisation. In most countries, data protection is taken very seriously and enforced through strict regulations (e.g. GDPR) which every organisation who holds personal data must adhere to. However, high-profile data breaches continue to occur. Research suggests that data protection controls have not kept pace with the degree to which organisations are experimenting with digital technologies and the unprecedented data volumes. Many organisations are unable to detect when or where their data systems have been breached. In order to comply with regulatory requirements to protect personal data and avoid potentially significant legal, financial, and reputational implications of a data breach, many organisations must improve their personal data protection approaches. This paper presents the key components or ‘capability building blocks’ of a conceptual framework in the area of Personal Data Protection (PDP) within the organisational context. This framework was developed based on the findings or themes that emerged from a systematic literature review (SLR) in this area followed by an open innovation approach. The resultant conceptual framework can be used by organisations to undertake a holistic analysis of their personal data protection capability. The framework also includes a set of POMs (Practices, Outcomes and Metrics) which acts as a roadmap for organisations to improve upon their current level of maturity in this area to effectively protect personal data and to demonstrate that the organisation is a trustworthy data custodian. © 2019, Curran Associates Inc.

Therefore, it is necessary to address what should be considered by requirements engineers in the elicitation and specification phases of embedded systems. However, understanding embedded systems and their environment is a strenuous activity. Hence, requirements engineers need to know the core concepts related to ES and also a systematic guide to consider these concepts in the development process. [Goal] This paper presents a metamodel based on a systematic literature review (SLR) that can support the elicitation of ES concepts. Additionally, we used the metamodel as a guide to the development of a requirements elicitation process. [Method] We used the studies of an SLR as a basis for the metamodel development and their concepts as input for an investigation of actions that are suitable to be used in our elicitation process. The proposed metamodel concepts were evaluated by a domain expert, and we applied the actions of the process to elicit requirements of an infusion pump system. [Results] The metamodel has 118 entities that represent the RE concepts for ES, and the elicitation process has 49 actions to guide requirements identification and definition. [Conclusion] The metamodel can be used by practitioners to check if they are eliciting the appropriate information for the development of embedded systems. Moreover, it can assist future research. Besides, the process can help organizations in improving their requirements practices to support completeness and correctness of ES elicitation. © 2018 IEEE.","Embedded systems; Metamodel; Process; Requirements elicitation; Requirements engineering","Processing; Requirements engineering; Development process; Domain experts; Infusion pump; Meta model; Metamodel development; Requirements elicitation; Systematic literature review (SLR); Embedded systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538658413,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

It's called HDD because its steering ability to avoid existing utilities or other obstacles either horizontally, vertically and even pulled back where she got its name. HDD was developed in California in the 1970s and was introduced in Europe in 1986. Since year 1992 up to 2016 there are about 40 thousand unit HDD machine were sold worldwide. Contractors, consultants, municipalities and decision makers are always in difficulties to determine the installation cost and the duration required when using the HDD method due to the presence of many qualitative factors. Understanding the HDD productivity factors will assist the stakeholders to overcome this matter. The aims of this study are to identify the existing HDD productivity factors, identify the factors that affect HDD productivity, identify the current tools that are used by current researcher, and identify the open problems and areas related to HDD productivity for improvement. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried to previous related papers retrieved by a manual search, critically analysed and discussed.

Therefore, ERP system is important strategy for organization's survival. One of the critical issues that affect a successful ERP implementation is the implementation method. In previous research, it showed that many organizations had faced complexity when they were implementing ERP in order to meet their requirements. In other cases, the ERP systems are unable to provide solution which is a simplicity of the necessary business processes. The ERP implementation complexity is one of the factors that lead the failures. Thus, here, we intend to propose an agile approach to reduce complexity and eventually our intention is to improve ERP implementing to become more successful. In this study, we are employing a systematic literature review (SLR) approach to identify the principles factors of the agile methods for ERP implementation. In result of employing this SLR method, we found that agile values and principles are correlated in ERP implementation complexity. © 2018 IEEE.","agile methods; complexity; ERP implementation; systematic literature review","Agile manufacturing systems; Information management; Agile approaches; Agile methods; Business environments; Business Process; complexity; ERP implementation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Enterprise resource planning",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538658215,,,"English","Proc.

In 2014, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) regarding this subject was published. The authors concluded that there were several gaps in the literature, such as the low level of accuracy of the techniques and little consensus on appropriate cost drivers. The goal of our work is to provide an updated review of the state of the art based on this reference SLR work. We applied a Forward Snowballing approach, in which our seed set included the former SLR and its selected papers. We identified a strong indication of solutions based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods for effort estimation in Agile Software Development (ASD). We also identified that there is a gap in terms of agreement on suitable cost drivers. Thus, we applied Thematic Analysis in the selected papers and identified a representative set of 10 cost drivers for effort estimation.

Thus, the principles of Knowledge Management (KM) are presented as determinant and effective factors for the software product quality. There are several approaches to applying KM in an organization. However, for a KM approaches to succeed, it is important to conduct a KM diagnostic in order to analyze the KM current state that already exists in the organization. Objective: The objective of this paper is to present the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) conducted to summarize existing research on KM diagnostic in software development organizations. Method: SLR was performed by searching four electronic databases. We also performed backward snowballing from reference lists of selected studies. Results: From the SLR, we identified 24 studies addressing investigated differents approaches related to KM diagnostics in software development organizations. Conclusion: Based on our results we conclude that in the software engineering context the KM diagnosis practice still does not seem consolidated. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Knowledge Management; Knowledge Management Diagnostic; Software Engineering","Computer software selection and evaluation; Software design; Software engineering; Electronic database; Reference list; Software development organizations; Software product quality; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Knowledge management",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450365659,,,"English","ACM Int.

But with the vast amount of research papers available today it has become more challenging to search and screen for appropriate papers to include in the review. This paper has analyzed different approaches to a literature review and explains the evolution from the traditional literature review to a more modern systematic literature review. The systematic literature review (SLR) can be classified into four key stages: Planning, Conducting, Analysis Synthesis, and Reporting. The purpose of this paper is to propose a modified SLR process that includes automation and bibliometrics. Automation is a method that can operationalize the manual tasks of the SLR by using specific tools and computer systems. Bibliometrics is a method to analyze the bibliographic data of published literature to provide an overview of the body of knowledge for a given field of inquiry. The proposed modified SLR process improves the previous versions that rely only on manual search and extraction, by combining the strength of both methods and integrating them into the stages of the SLR process.

The implementation of software processes improvement, such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), can improve quality of software products. However, CMMI as a process improvement model has been rarely discussed in GSD context. To fill this gap a systematic literature study was conducted by using Kitchenham's method. It investigated GSD research from several databases between 2013-2018. At the end there are 12 selected papers. The findings indicate that CMMI is essential for the success of GSD projects. However, it requires multiple customizations and combinations with other standards.

Therefore, the overall goal of this article is to provide an objective summary of the current state-of-the-art concerning how GIS has been used and what methods and analysis have been applied in the field of cultural heritage. In this sense, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of the literature on the application of GIS in cultural heritage is carried out. To do so, the WOS and Scopus databases were considered. The results show that the dominant application of GIS is in the realisation of inventory and cataloguing of archaeological and architectural heritage. As a result of the quantitative analysis, we also verify the principal sources in which most studies have been published, highlighting the ""ISPRS Archives"" with 14 publications, the ""Lecture Notes in Computer Science"" with 9, and ""Proceedings of Digital Heritage"" with 6 publications. These data show that the sources that most publish mainly belong to the field of IT and Computer Science. In addition, the SLR shows that in the last three years there has been a greater tendency to use GIS to solve more specific problems of heritage through its use in conjunction with other tools such as BIM and photogrammetry. © Authors 2018.","Cultural heritage; Geographic information systems; GIS; State of the art; Systematic literature review","Architectural design; Information systems; Information use; Publishing; Architectural heritage; Cultural heritages; Literature reviews; Research questions; State of research; State of the art; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Geographic information systems","Ferreira-Lopes, P.; IUACC, HUM799, Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura, Universidad de SevillaSpain; email: pwanderley@us.es","Zlatanova S.Sithole G.Dragicevic S.","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing",16821750,,,,"English","Int.

A systematic mapping study (SMS) performed in 2013 structured the research area on the use of FLOSS projects in SEE. Objective: Update the 2013 SMS with studies published in the last five years, classifying and summarizing them to discuss trends and identify research gaps in the context of the use of FLOSS projects in SEE. Method: We retrieved and analyzed a set of 4132 papers published from 2013 to 2017, from which 33 papers were selected and classified. We analyzed the new results and compared them with those from the previous SMS to confirm or discover trends. Results: The updated mapping summarizes the studies published in the last five years, most of them in conferences. Our analysis confirmed trends previously observed for three facets (SE area, curriculum choice and assessment type) and discovered new trends for other facets. Conclusion: Studies report the use of FLOSS projects in regular, comprehensive SE courses. The prevalence of experience reports over solution proposals in the last five years may indicate that researchers are more concerned with the use and evaluation of existing proposals, although there are still opportunities for more empirical work based on sound educational research methods. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","FLOSS development model; Free software; Open source software; Systematic literature reviews","Curricula; Engineering education; Engineering research; Mapping; Open systems; Development model; Educational research; Experience report; FLOSS projects; Free software; Industry needs; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Open source software",,"Gottardi T.","Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450365031,,,"English","ACM Int.

It is recognized that one search technique to update secondary studies is forward snowballing and that the number of studies identified is dependent on the electronic databases selected. However, there is no consensus on what electronic database is most appropriate for applying forward snowballing. Objective: The main goal of this study is to evaluate the use of different electronic databases for applying forward snowballing to update secondary studies. Method: Six updates were performed using forward snowballing with support from two electronic databases, one specific (IEEE Xplore) and the other generic (Google Scholar) and three combinations were evaluated to obtain new evidence during secondary studies updating: (1) searching using Google Scholar as electronic database; (2) searching using IEEE Xplore as electronic database; and (3) searching using both, IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar as complementary electronic databases. Results: The use of a specific electronic database is not indicated for forward snowballing application to update SLRs, since many relevant studies may not be identified. However, the use of a generic database is sufficient to discover the majority of the studies.

However, a SLR study always faces validity threats because there exist subjective biases in certain steps of a SLR, such as identification of relevant studies and primary study selection. In software engineering field, many systematic review studies have adopted several methods to increase the reliability, for example, group decision and pilots search. In this paper, in order to reduce subjective biases, we propose a different solution to improve objectively the quality of SLR, which aims to apply text similarity analysis into two stages of a SLR. We propose that the synonym and hypernym relations of WordNet can be used to expand the search strings to improve the paper search process. In addition, through calculating the relevance of a paper and research issues according to text similarity analysis, the primary study selection can be improved.

Due to advancement in the data flow, there is a fair chance of data loss and its misuse. To manage this, it is usually required to draw whole information in form of graphs or presentable form which is termed as social network. In this context, to get some calculative idea about social relations from that network is called a Social Network Analysis (SNA). The research on SNA has been continuously performed from last decade or so. It is required to review and present major contributions in SNA to research community. Therefore, this article conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to select fifty two research studies. As a result, twenty three algorithms, eleven tools and ten frameworks in the domain of SNA have been presented. This facilitates researchers to discovery latest SNA developments within a single study. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Organizational network analysis; SNA; Social network analysis","Big data; Social networking (online); Data flow; Modern paradigms; Organizational network; Research communities; Research studies; Social relations; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Information management",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450365406,,,"English","ACM Int.

It can occur within a group of two or more students. Therefore, the learners' grouping is an essential task for establishing collaboration and cooperation among them to achieve a common goal. However, with the increasing number of students as well as their different settings (academic, cognitive, emotional, social, etc.), the students grouping task becomes harder and more complex to build a good collaborative learn-ing environment. Hence, several researchers proposed different approaches for obtaining approximate solutions to handle this diversity and take advantages from it. In this context, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) to pinpoint the relevant research works that address the students grouping problem. We also we focus on the ACO bio-inspired approach to discuss its advantages and how students group formation can be initially constructed by ACO method. In accordance with this, we adapt and simulate an existing ACO algorithm with randomly generated data. The obtained results show an interesting starting point for further works in order to develop a new approach based on real educational data. © 2018 IEEE.","ant colony optimization (ACO); cell formation/group technology; clustering; Collaborative learning Teams (CLT); students' group formation problem (SGFP); systematic literature review (SLR)","Ant colony optimization; Artificial intelligence; Cellular manufacturing; Teaching; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO); Cell formation; clustering; Collaborative learning; Group formations; Systematic literature review (SLR); Students",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538646236,,,"English","Int.

Silo culture will produce silo data that affects things like, non-uniform data formats, data duplication, and information. To overcome the silo cultute in an organization because of the use of different information technologies (IT) IT integration is carried out. IT integration can also support collaboration between components in an organization that will further enhance business processes. This integration can be done by developing an integration platform. In this study a systematic literature review (SLR) and IT integration metanalysis were carried out in an organization to gain an understanding of the architecture or layers, technology and integration platform features. In some publications the platform architecture is designed based on layers, such as business layers, applications, data, services, and so on. In this study, a meta-analysis was performed using Cronbach alpha to test the reliability of the data found and principal component analysis (PCA) or commonly called factor analysis to determine the optimal layer in the integration platform architecture.

It is important for librarians to know which methods of teaching engineering information literacy (EIL) are most effective for student learning, in order to make efficient and effective use of student and librarian time. Purpose/Hypothesis - The authors reviewed the existing literature to find indications of the most effective methods for teaching and/or integrating EIL, both in face-to-face and online instruction. Design/Method - The authors have completed the first stages of a systematic literature review (SLR), through the creation of the final dataset. The initial searches generated a set of 1224 papers prior to duplicate removal. Duplicate removal and multiple rounds of review, using authors-created inclusion and exclusion criteria, narrowed the final dataset to 13 papers. Scope/Method - The lessons learned in the process around searching, tools for data evaluation, and articulation of criteria are presented. As a result of this portion of the SLR process, the authors identified characteristics of the undergraduate-focused EIL literature that are shared. Results/Discussion - A brief summary of the process to arrive at a final dataset of 13 papers, the challenges in the process, and the refinements made at each step are outlined. Conclusion - There are several preliminary conclusions to be drawn, many of which will not be surprising to the engineering librarian community. The dataset came down to just 13 items because much of the EIL literature is based on student self-report data on how the class went, or was it enjoyable, rather than on actual student learning gains. As such, these papers did not meet the criteria for demonstrated learning gains as a measure of effectiveness. In addition, some papers were excluded for lack of clarity about methods. In these studies it is not evident how either the intervention and/or the assessment was conducted, with regard to timing, instrument used, etc. Some additional papers were excluded because a control or comparison group was not included to establish ""effectiveness"" of the intervention. Overall, the authors note the EIL literature frequently reports descriptive statistics, showing that data has been gathered, but sometimes falls short of a full analysis that allows the researchers to draw meaningful/well-grounded conclusions from the data. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.",,,,,"American Society for Engineering Education",21535965,,,,"English","ASEE Annu.

In order to maximize the success of software projects, agile methods focus on people and their interactions. However, agile projects still suffer from the risks of failure. Understanding that PM is a complex and central activity in the SDP, this paper aims to map how academic studies describe the PM in the software development environment, what good practices are described by these studies and how the software industry has applied the PM. Therefore it is intended to build a PM model for agile software development approaches. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was carried out in order to obtain data regarding the state of the art of PM in the agile development, and also a questionnaire format survey, which was answered by professionals working in the industry to map the application of PM mechanisms in software development organizations. From the data obtained in the SLR and in the questionnaires applied it was proposed a model of People Management. The proposed model was generically constructed to serve as a PM guide in agile projects, regardless organization characteristics and the development team where the model will be implemented. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Agile Methodologies; People management; People Management Model; Software Development Process","Agile manufacturing systems; Application programs; Information systems; Information use; Project management; Surveys; Agile Methodologies; Agile software development; People management; Software development environment; Software development organizations; Software development process; Software project management; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software design",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450365598,,,"Portuguese","ACM Int.

In face of this, we propose investigating how the UML has been customized to create DSMLs that provide proper support for SaSs modeling. To achieve this, we performed a Systematic Literature Review (SRL) by retrieving studies with snowballing technique, selecting studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and extracting and analyzing data to answer our research questions. As the outcome, we retrieved 786 studies and selected 16 primary studies published between 2005 and 2017.

To address software security, various approaches, techniques, methods, practices, and models have been proposed and developed. However, recent research shows that many software development methodologies do not explicitly include methods for incorporating software security during the development of software as it evolves from requirements engineering to its final disposal. The primary objective of this research is to study the state-of-the-art of security in the context of SDLC by following systematic mapping study (SMS).

By increasing the popularity of touchscreen platform as an input method in mobiles phones, touch gesture behaviour is becoming more significantly important in interaction with the phone. Due to increasing demand for safer access in touchscreen mobile phones, old strategies like pins, tokens, or passwords have failed to stay abreast of the challenges. By utilizing touch gesture behaviour biometric techniques, the authentication mechanism will improve and would make it more difficult for a shoulder surfer to replay the password, even if he observes the entire gesture. The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic literature review SLR for the current state-of-the-art in the field of touch features gesture. The results of this research identified thirteen touch features followed by the previous studies (PSs) to authenticate users. However, based on the schemes followed by the previous studies (PSs) there was not any scheme that extract and use all touch features for mobile user authentication. There are number of areas of future work that could be carried out to advance upon this research and within the area of authentication on mobile devices. Each of the pervious study (PS) extracted only one or more features. The maximum number of features used in S14 year 2014 and S15 year 2015 were seven features.

The development of such systems involves design decisions that directly impact the quality of the software. For an early decision making, software developers can use model-based prediction approaches for (non-)functional quality properties. Unfortunately, the accuracy of these approaches is challenged by newly introduced hardware features like multiple cores within a single CPU (multicores) and their dependence on shared memory and other shared resources. Objectives: Our goal is to understand whether and how existing model-based performance prediction approaches face this challenge. We plan to use gained insights as foundation for enriching existing prediction approaches with capabilities to predict systems running on multicores. Methods: We perform a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify current model-based prediction approaches in the context of multicores. Results: Our SLR covers the software engineering, embedded systems, High Performance Computing, and Software Performance Engineering domains for which we examined 34 sources in detail. We found various performance prediction approaches which tries to increase prediction accuracy for multicore systems by including shared memory designs to the prediction models. Conclusion: However, our results show that the memory designs models are only in an initial phase.

However, there is still a fierce debate about whether or not the pervasive Web content can act as an alternative means to gather evidence for EBSE. Aim: To help ourselves enter this debate, this work aims to obtain some pre-evidence of reviewing Web documents for verifying the value and reliability of online materials. Method: Given the unique characteristics of Web content, we adapted the traditional Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology in EBSE, and conducted a review case study in the deep learning domain. Results: Our study selected four different search sources and captured 5082 'deep learning'-relevant Web documents. After a set of thematic synthesis steps ranging from keyword identification to brainstorming, the collected raw data were eventually evolved into a mind map of six semantic topics. Conclusions: We confirm that Web content can provide valuable information as supplementary evidence in EBSE. However, reviewing Web content introduces more search source bias rather than academic publications' location bias that is due to factors like ease of access or indexing levels in digital libraries. © 2017 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Evidence-based Software Engineering; Systematic Literature Review; Topic Modeling; Web Content","Deep learning; Digital libraries; Semantics; Websites; Academic publications; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Scientific publications; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Topic Modeling; Web content; Software engineering",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538626498,,,"English","Proc. - Asia-Pac.

They aided in the active investigation of human aspects in ASD. However, capability measurement and prediction with respect to agile workforce, owing to its importance, is an area that needs spotlight. Objective: The objective of this paper is to present the state of the art relating to capability measurement of software engineers and teams working in ASD projects. Method: We carried out a systematic literature review (SLR) focused on identifying attributes used for measuring and predicting the capabilities of individual software engineers and teams. Results: Evidence from 16 studies showed attributes that can measure capabilities of engineers and teams, and also attributes that can be used as capability predictors. Further, different instruments used to measure those attributes were presented. Conclusions: The SLR presented a wide list of attributes that were grouped into various categories. This information can be used by project managers as, for example, a checklist to consider when allocating software engineers to teams and in turn teams to a project. Further, this study indicated the necessity for an investigation into capability prediction models. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Agile software development; Capability measurement; Capability prediction; Competence; Individual capability; Systematic literature review; Team capability","Application programs; Engineers; Forecasting; Human resource management; Agile software development; Competence; Individual capability; Systematic literature review; Team capability; Software design",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450354141,,,"English","ACM Int.

Therefore, the goal of our work is to provide an updated review of the state of the art based on this reference SLR work. We applied a Forward Snowballing approach, in which our seed set are the former SLR and its selected papers. We identified changes in this new review comparing it with the reference SLR: XP methodology was mentioned in just a few works; Use Case Points (UCP) method and Case Points as size metric were not found. We also observed a strong indication of solutions based on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning methods for effort estimation in Agile Software Development (ASD). Finally, we identified that in the reference SLR there is a gap in terms of agreement on suitable cost drivers. Thus, in our updated review, we applied Thematic Analysis in the selected papers and identified a representative set of 10 cost drivers for effort estimation. © 2018 Universitat zu Koln.

These PPP projects have diverse attributes depending on the type of project, institutional culture, and structure of ownership and management. Based on these key aspects, the projects can either be successful or unsuccessful depending on economic and financial measures. This paper investigates the use of PPPs for the delivery of higher education institutions and finds trends of PPP usage in the United States. This is performed by first collecting records of PPP projects in educational institutions by applying the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. The result of the SLR methodology is a collection of U.S.-based higher education PPP projects and a classification of project types and where they are located. The results at this stage show that PPP projects have been used the most in the South and Northeast as compared to other geographic locations in the U.S. majority of the projects were student housing complexes for the universities and there has been a trend for expansion to other areas such as utilities, parking garages, and health centers. The results also show an increasing trend in project sizes between 1994 and 2017. This paper provides a detailed review of the use of PPPs in higher education institutions with a focus on how SLR was conducted and the identified trends. It was noticed that PPP was not only used by public universities, but also spread to private universities. The results of this paper are expected to shed light on the increased PPP usage in the educational sector in the U.S. © 2018 ASCE.",,"Garages (parking); Housing; Educational institutions; Higher education institutions; Infrastructure project; Institutional cultures; Public private partnerships; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Universities and colleges; Sustainable development",,"Lee Y.Harris R.Wang C.Harper C.Berryman C.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",,9780784481301,,,"English","Constr.

This work performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of current estimates practices in the development of agile software and the most used size metrics as inputs for these estimates, collecting and documenting them for a future comparison of their accuracy. With the realization of SLR, it was identified that Story Point and Point of Function are the most used metrics in agile projects as the basis for estimating size, time, effort, productivity and cost. Based on these two-size metrics, it was performed a case study with the estimation of effort, time and cost for an agile project of a software factory, where the actual development values were compared with the estimates made to analyze which provided the estimates that most closely approximated the actual values that were estimated. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

Universities at some points provide entrepreneurship skills to their students so as to prepare the students on setting up their own businesses instead of depending and relying on getting paid jobs in their chosen industries. However, Social entrepreneurship is different from traditional entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship does not look at the profit only, but focuses on the impact of business to the society while on the other hand, traditional entrepreneurship deals with the implementation of such ideas to do business and get more profit. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the importance of social entrepreneurship in higher education via a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach adopted from Kitchenham (2004). This paper offers systematic investigation into the importance and approaches of social entrepreneurship in higher education using extant literature as the basis of analysis and discussion. The importance of social entrepreneurship in higher education can produce graduates that have significant knowledge and skills of being a social entrepreneur as well as have relevant disciplinary knowledge and skills, ethics and morality. There are many approaches that are being used by the universities to help these students.

Since 1998, a growing body of knowledge has been emerging from the IGLC community, in relation to synergies between LC and Sustainability. Both seek to reduce waste and maximise value, but through different approaches and perspectives. The most common mistake, however, is a tool-focused framework for integration, which overlooks the conceptual differences between these two initiatives. The aim of this study, therefore, is to review the progress made in understanding the linkages and inconsistencies between the two initiatives, through conducting a critical systematic literature review (SLR) and synthesising the findings of 'LC and Sustainability' studies published in IGLC conferences over the past 25 years.

This paper studies available literature to identify and map several types of real-time data that can be collected directly on a construction site or indirectly when real-time automated data collection is not feasible and human intervention is required to record desired information. This paper will focus on construction safety and classify the factors that pertain to worker safety. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method will be used to map the factors and technologies that have been tested on sites for construction safety. This paper will explore both hard data (like location and physiological status) and soft data (like attitude and experience of workers, and information pertaining to safety training and safety culture in an organization). This paper will serve as an index for researchers and practitioners working on construction safety or wanting to learn about real-time construction worker safety research. The maps resulting from this study will serve as a guide to understand what data types are required for a specific problem, how to collect them and how the data can be analyzed.

This is a tertiary study that follows the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process as put forth by Kitchenham in her seminal paper, based on five criteria: estimation technique, estimation accuracy, type of dataset and independent variables used in empirical research on effort estimation. Our study covering 820 Primary Studies through 14 SLRs, shows that Software Effort Estimation studies focus more on statistical techniques and Machine Learning is taking precedence in comparison to the others; whereas Expert Judgement is preferred by the industry due to its intuitiveness. There is a need for models that are simple to understand and global, due to the distributed nature of software development. The studies are inconclusive about the accuracy benefits of using a within company dataset vs.external datasets. Machine learning techniques such FL and GA in combination with Analogy methods generate more accurate estimates. There is increasing consensus on the use of Mean Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE), Median Magnitude of Relative Error (MdMRE) and Prediction Pred (25%) as the accuracy metric. 78% of the Primary Studies reported accuracy using MMRE. The best MMRE reported is in the range of 7 to 75. ISBSG (International Software Benchmarking Standards Group) and Desharnais datasets with 27% and 17% usage respectively are the most widely used datasets in empirical studies on effort estimation. Fewer than 20 independent variables account for more than 90% impact of variables in empirical analysis on Software effort estimation. © 2017 IEEE.","Effort Prediction; Software Cost Estimation; Software Effort Estimation; Systematic Literature Review; Tertiary Survey","Artificial intelligence; Budget control; Learning systems; Object oriented programming; Software design; Effort prediction; International Software Benchmarking Standards Group; Machine learning techniques; Mean magnitude of relative errors; Software cost estimations; Software effort estimation; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Cost estimating",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",21593442,9781509011339,85QXA,,"English","IEEE Reg 10 Annu Int Conf Proc TENCON",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044191749

While the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a well-established methodology, it is rarely used in the field of engineering education. Though the use of the term ""systematic"" suggests a clear-cut process and there are resources available to describe the major steps of the method, the initial steps of a SLR are inherently messy-i.e., they heavily rely on the researcher's judgement and decision-making. Unfortunately, the messiness embedded in these steps is rarely discussed or described in existing resources. In this study, we reflect on the ""messiness"" of initiating a SLR on broadening participation in engineering and computer science. Informed by two existing approaches to reflection, we used the STAARA (Situation-Task-Affect-Action-Result-Aftermath) framework to reflect on the ways in which we resolved important decisions associated with one overarching situation and several corresponding tasks, affects, actions; the aftermath is also discussed. This paper includes insights from our experience that can help other researchers navigate the initial steps of a SLR. © 2017 IEEE.","Broadening participation; Reflection; Research methods; Systematic review","Decision making; Reflection; Broadening participation; Clear cuts; Engineering and computer science; Practical solutions; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Engineering education",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",15394565,9781509059195,PFECD,,"English","Proc.

To date most SLRs have been conducted using a search strategy involving several digital libraries. However, significant issues have been reported for digital libraries and applying such search strategy requires substantial effort. On the other hand, snowballing has recently arisen as a potentially more efficient alternative or complementary solution. Nevertheless, it requires a relevant seed set of papers. [Aims] This paper proposes and evaluates a hybrid search strategy combining searching in a specific digital library (Scopus) with backward and forward snowballing. [Method] The proposed hybrid strategy was applied to two previously published SLRs that adopted database searches. We investigate whether it is able to retrieve the same included papers with lower effort in terms of the number of analysed papers. The two selected SLRs relate respectively to elicitation techniques (not confined to Software Engineering (SE)) and to a specific SE topic on cost estimation. [Results] Our results provide preliminary support for the proposed hybrid search strategy as being suitable for SLRs investigating a specific research topic within the SE domain. Furthermore, it helps overcoming existing issues with using digital libraries in SE. [Conclusions] The hybrid search strategy provides competitive results, similar to using several digital libraries. However, further investigation is needed to evaluate the hybrid search strategy. © 2017 IEEE.","hybrid strategy; search strategy; snowballing; systematic review","Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Search engines; Software engineering; Database searches; Elicitation techniques; Hybrid search strategies; Hybrid strategies; Search strategies; snowballing; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Digital libraries",,,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,9781509040391,,,"English","Int.

In fact, ITS makes inferences about a student's proficiency level in order to dynamically adapt the learning content or the tutoring style. Around the same time, emotions, whether positive or negative, affect the learning process. Accordingly, the regulation of learners' negative emotional state, is an imperious factor in learning, in order to optimize learners' performances and to improve learning productivity during an ITS episode. Firstly, this paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on strategies for regulating the emotional state of learners in the point of view of (a) emotion recognition, (b) emotion modelling, (c) emotion recognition theories, and (d) emotion recognition approaches and methods. Secondly, the paper proposes a new intelligent method, and presents its architecture as a Fuzzy Emotional Regulation for ITS distributed under the Multiagent Approach.

Several researchers have reported their experiences in applying SLRs in Software Engineering (SE) however, there is still a lack of studies discussing the iterative nature of the protocol definition, especially how it should be perceived by researchers conducting SLRs. Objective: The main goal of this study is to perform a survey aiming to identify: (i) the perception of SE researchers related to protocol definition; (ii) the activities of the review process that typically lead to protocol refinements; and (iii) which protocol items are refined in those activities. Method: A survey was performed with 53 SE researchers.

The application of right data analysis technique during the SLR evaluation stage would give an insight to the researcher in achieving the SLR objective. This paper presents how descriptive analysis and text analysis can be applied to achieve one of the common SLR objectives which is to study the progress of specific research domain. These techniques have been demonstrated to synthesis the progress of Master Data Management research domain. Using descriptive analysis technique, this study has identified a trend of related literary works distribution by years, sources, and publication types. Meanwhile, text analysis shows the common terms and interest topics in the Master Data Management research which are 1) master data, 2) data quality, 3) business intelligence, 4) business process, 5) data integration, 6) big data, 7) data governance, 8) information governance, 9) data management and 10) product data.

In this paper, we summarize the existing condition of smart campus development in term of features, supported technologies, and applications were built using systematic literature review (SLR) as the standard methodology used to solve any problems by tracing the results of previous research. The problems declared in SLR are commonly called as research question (RQ). To achieve that goal, we define some RQs related to that scope and clarify each question by tracing previous research papers which are indexed in reputable journal databases such as IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Springerlink, and ScienceDirect. After synthesizing 29 articles, the results are: Contactless technology provides an easier way to enter data when accessing a particular room or equipment than using a keyboard; IoT supports an easier way to report real-time environment status; cloud computing is used to organize various information effectively and provide data services; iCampus becomes a popular smart campus model and if we map the applications that have been built into iCampus; there is no applications as part of iHealth domain. The main contribution of smart campus development based on previous research is to make easier in all campus aspect life. The contribution expected through this paper is to provide an overview for researchers who want to build applications in a campus as research challenge so that they can use appropriate technology and meet the characteristics of smart campus. © 2017 IEEE.","research challenge; SLR; smart campus; summary","Appropriate technologies; Contactless technology; Real-time environment; Research challenges; smart campus; summary; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR)",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781538631003,,,"English","Int.

Based on experience in a large number of SM/SLR studies, we and many other researchers have found the data extraction in SLRs to be time consuming and error-prone, thus raising the real need for heuristics and guidelines for effective and efficient data extraction in these studies, especially to be learnt by junior and young researchers. As a 'guideline' paper, this paper contributes a synthesized list of challenges usually faced during SLRs' data extraction phase and the corresponding solutions (guidelines).

Search and selection of primary studies in Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) is labour intensive, and hard to replicate and update. Aims. We explore a machine learning approach to support semi-automated search and selection in SLRs to address these weaknesses. Method. We 1) train a classifier on an initial set of papers, 2) extend this set of papers by automated search and snowballing, 3) have the researcher validate the top paper, selected by the classifier, and 4) update the set of papers and iterate the process until a stopping criterion is met. Results. We demonstrate with a proof-of-concept tool that the proposed automated search and selection approach generates valid search strings and that the performance for subsets of primary studies can reduce the manual work by half. Conclusions. The approach is promising and the demonstrated advantages include cost savings and replicability. The next steps include further tool development and evaluate the approach on a complete SLR. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Automation; Machine learning; Reinforcement learning; Research identification; Study selection; Systematic literature review","Artificial intelligence; Automation; Learning systems; Paper; Reinforcement learning; Software engineering; Automated searches; Literature studies; Machine learning approaches; Proof of concept; Stopping criteria; Study selection; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Education",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450348041,,,"English","ACM Int.

However, GSD is a complex phenomenon and there are many challenges associated with it, especially that related to Software Process Improvement (SPI). The aim of this work is to identify humans' related factors that can positively impact the SPI process in GSD organizations and proposed a hypothetical framework of the identified success factors in relation to SPI implementation. We have adopted the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method in order to identify the success factors. Using the SLR approach, total ten success factors were identified. The paper also reported the Critical Success Factors (CSFs) for SPI implementation following the criteria of the factors having a frequency ≥ 50% as critical. Our results reveal that five out of ten factors are critical for SPI program. Based on the analysis of the identified success factors, we have presented a hypothetical framework that has highlighted an association between the identified success factors and the implementation of the SPI program in GSD environment.

The domain from which such knowledge is extracted is typically existing research literature found in journals, conference proceedings, books and gray literature. Empirical approaches that include various systematic review (SR) methodologies such as systematic literature review (SLR) and systematic mapping study (SMS) are found to be effective in this context. They adopt rigorous planning, follow repeatable and well-defined processes, and produce unbiased and evidence-based outcomes. Despite these significant benefits, the general trend on using these systematic review (SR) methodologies is not encouraging in SE research. The primary reasons emerging are twofold - a) SR methodologies are largely cited as time-consuming activities and b) lack of guidance to conduct systematic reviews. This tutorial discusses these concerns and describes an effective way of using SR methodologies for SE research. Objectives: Attendees will be introduced to the key concepts, methods and processes for conducting systematic literature reviews (SLR) and systematic mapping studies (SMS). The benefits, limitations, guidelines for using SR methodologies in an effective manner will discussed in the session. Attendees will be guided on the appropriate formulation of a research question and sub questions; the development of a review protocol such as inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, quality criteria and classification structures; and execution of review protocol using digital libraries and syntheses of review data. A web based software tool1, for supporting the systematic literature review process will be demonstrated and attendees will get the opportunity to use the tool to conduct the review to help in identification of relevant research and extraction and synthesis of data.

Several challenges occur when building simulation software, because simulations require complex software developed in a dynamic construction process. That is why simulation software engineering (SSE) is emerging lately as a research focus. The dichotomous trade-off between scalability and efficiency (SE) on the one hand and maintainability and portability (MP) on the other hand is one of the core challenges. We report on the SE/MP trade-off in the context of an ongoing systematic literature review (SLR). After characterizing the issue of the SE/MP trade-off using two examples from our own research, we (1) review the 33 identified articles that assess the trade-off, (2) summarize the proposed solutions for the tradeoff, and (3) discuss the findings for SSE and future work. Overall, we see evidence for the SE/MP trade-off and first solution approaches. However, a strong empirical foundation has yet to be established; general quantitative metrics and methods supporting software developers in addressing the trade-off have to be developed. We foresee considerable future work in SSE across scientific communities. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Computer software; Construction; Efficiency; Engineering research; Scalability; Software engineering; Building simulation; Dynamic construction; Empirical foundations; Large scale simulations; Quantitative metrics; Scientific community; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Economic and social effects",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509052240,,,"English","Proc.

However, there are not many papers that study this issue holistically and uncover the current state of this integration. Aim: This study sets out to answer the following research question: What is the current state of integration between agile processes and usability? Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS). A SMS is a form of systematic literature review that aims to identify and classify the research papers published about a specified issue. Results: We retrieved a total of 161 primary studies, which we categorized according to four criteria: process, practice, team and technology integration. The largest group refers to process integration with a total of 76 primary studies. Judging by the increase in the number of publications over the last decade, the integration of human-computer interaction (HCI) activities and techniques into the ASDP is an issue of notable interest. Conclusions: There are very few papers that study the literature holistically and report the current state of usability in the ASDP. Additionally, there are no formalized proposals for adopting usability techniques in ASDP. © 2016 IEEE.","Agile software development; systematic mapping study; usability; user-centred design","Data visualization; Human computer interaction; Mapping; Software engineering; Usability engineering; User centered design; Agile software development; Agile software development process; Human computer interaction (HCI); Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Technology Integration; usability; Usability techniques; Software design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509016334,,,"English","Proc.

Method: We identified 170 secondary studies that were reviewed to answer a set of Research Questions (RQ) related to the practical conduction of secondary studies in SE. Results: Results show that both SLRs and SMs have generic RQs, broad search strings, and adopt automatic search as search strategy. However, quality assessment has been more widely adopted in SLRs.

Although the volume of methodological articles and books focusing on the SLR is growing, certain aspects of this methodological approach seem to be neglected. Firstly, literature focused on the SLR concentrates mainly on conducting the review by one person and is not giving details or guidelines on how to cooperate in teams. Secondly, despite a decent number of the SLR articles in scientific journals, information about the analytical and synthesis part of the SLR lacks details. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe in detail the procedures and the tools used during one SLR conducted by a team of five researchers. Moreover, as the team content analysis was used for the analytical part of the literature review detail description of the activities and the used tools during the content analysis is presented. This article is framed as a descriptive single case study that is based on project documents, communication, meetings minutes and observations conducted by me in the role of the SLR team leader. The described SLR is the first phase of a three year research project that focuses on the ways of using feedback from customers as knowledge for new product or service development and innovations. Besides the detailed description of the whole process, this article also discusses some factors that were influencing the quality, effectiveness and efficiency of the team management. The following factors were identified as crucial for the team management: software tools, knowledge of software tools, experience with the content analysis, activities of team members in other research projects and teaching, and nature of externally funded grant project. © 2017 Academic Conferences Limited.

Nevertheless, there is no available study that provides detail review of the published software process improvement SLRs. Objective: The aim of this article is to classify the SLRs of SPI in order to identify the main research areas covered and evaluate the quality of the published SLRs. Methodology: A tertiary study was conducted to review the SLRs published by other researchers on the topic of SPI. Results: Twenty-four SLR articles were identified in the field of SPI. Results show that the quality of the selected SLRs on SPI is decreasing over the recent years. The most popular research topics are factors affecting SPI and process models. Conclusions: This study provides the review and state of the art in the context of SPI research. The results of this article would be of great interest for future SPI researchers by providing in depth understanding of various research areas in SPI. The number of process improvement SLRs is increasing and the overall quality is decreasing, which could lessen their potential impact on SPI practice.

The objectives of this paper are to identify what are the main characteristics of current Agile Model-Driven Development (Agile MDD) approaches, as well as the benefits and the problems of adopting these approaches. Fifteen publications have been identified and selected as primary studies on which we conducted the analysis. The results show that Agile development and MDD can coexist and benefit from their integration. However, combining Agile and MDD is still in its early stages and more effort is required in research to advance this area. The main contributions of this paper are: detailed and condensed results in the context of current Agile MDD approaches, detailed results on the benefits of Agile MDD in practice, and the observed problems and challenges of the current Agile MDD approaches. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Studies show a steady growth of this sector and, for increases the competitive advantages, these organizations come to use tools and business strategy methods in their decision makings. These methods can contribute to increased competitiveness when they are supported by a Performance Measurement System (PMS). PMS measures the results through performance indicators, providing more accurate controls over the decision-making processes, as an example, when actions involve internal and external environment aspects, such as Cost Measurement, Quality and Stakeholders evaluate and satisfaction. This articles presents a Bibliometric Analysis of a study and Author Cocitations for a sample of scientific articles, developed in parallel with a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) involving disciplines relating to NPOs and PMS. A Systematic Review adopts judicious methods, with a more consistent basis for the quality of information for a set of scientific publications.

However, this is a time-consuming and tedious activity, as it involves reading a large volume of material. Besides, several abstracts are sometimes not well-written. In this scenario, improving an abstract has been a concern, including the adoption of graphical abstracts. However, there is a lack of works that provide evidence about the relevance of using graphical abstracts to select studies within secondary studies. Objective: The objective of this paper is to analyze whether graphical abstracts based on Concept Maps (CM) could support selection of candidate primary st udies in SLR and MS. Method: We created a set of graphical abstracts based on CMs and conducted a pilot study to compare performance, effectiveness, and level of tiredness, boring of graduat e st udents to select candidate st udies using conventional abstract and using graphical abstracts. Results: Our quantitative analysis shows that graphical abstracts based on CMs have performance and effectiveness similar to selection conducted manually; however, the selection activity is perceived as less tedious by the researchers. Conclusions: Graphical abstracts based on CMs can become a relevant element to be included during conduction of SLR and MS.",,"Software engineering; Concept maps; Large volumes; Mapping studies; Pilot studies; Systematic literature review (SLR); Abstracting",,,"Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering",,9789873806988,,,"English","CIbSE - Ibero-Am.

This paper describes a systematic literature review (SLR) on the role of the results of Big Data Analytics in corporate decisions. Initially, 1652 papers were identified from various sources. Filtering through the 5-step process, 20 relevant studies were selected for analysis in this SLR. The findings of this study are fourfold in the area of: (a) usage of the results of Big Data Analytics in corporate decision-making; (b) the types of business functions where analytics has been fruitfully utilised; (c) the impact of analytics on decision-making; and (d) the impediments to using Big Data Analytics in corporate decision-making. Also, on the management front, two important issues identified are: (i) aligning data-driven decision-making with business strategy and (ii) collaboration across business functions for effective flow of Big Data and information. On the technical front, big data present some challenges due to the lack of tools to process such properties of Big Data as variety, veracity, volume, and velocity. We observe from this analysis that, thus far, little scientific research has focused on understanding how to address the analytics results in corporate decision-making. This paper ends with some recommendations for further research in this area. © Copyright 2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The importance of BPM to Business Process Management can be justified by the serious problems, which may arise in the latter, if the former is not conducted correctly. This can take place, inter alia, when an inappropriate choice of a BPM formalism for a given BPM context has been made. Such an improper choice is due not only to the availability of a huge number of BPM formalisms but also to the lack of guidelines assisting in the selection process. Our aim in this paper, is to propose a context-aware roadmap with associated methodological guidelines underpinning the selection of the appropriate BPM formalism. To this end, a systematic literature review (SLR) of studies on BPM formalisms quality has been undertaken. The contribution of this paper is threefold viz. the SLR itself, a context-aware roadmap, along with a context model inspired by the Zachman framework, and is a first step towards a decision support system for selecting the appropriate BPM formalism. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","BPM formalism; Context model; Context-aware selection; Methodological guidelines; Roadmap; SLR","Administrative data processing; Artificial intelligence; Competition; Decision support systems; Enterprise resource management; Information systems; Management information systems; Process engineering; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; BPM formalism; Context modeling; Context-Aware; Methodological guidelines; Roadmap; Information management","Awadid, A.; CRI, University of Paris 1 Pantheon-SorbonneFrance; email: afef.awadid@malix.univ-paris1.fr","Gulden J.Nurcan S.Reinhartz-Berger I.Bera P.Guedria W.","Springer Verlag",18651348,9783319594651,,,"English","Lect.

These definitions do not however provide equal prominence for the data governance within the cloud computing technology context. As such, this deficit calls for in-depth understanding of data governance and cloud Computing. This trend contributes to changes in data governance strategy in the organisation, such as the organisation's structure and regulations, people, technology, process, roles and responsibilities. This is one of the great challenges facing organizations today when they move their data to Cloud Computing environments, particularly how Cloud technology affects data governance. The authors' general observation reveals that the area of data governance in general is under researched and not widely practiced by organisations, let alone when it is concerned with cloud computing, where research is really in its infancy and far from reaching maturity. This paper attempts to identify the possible common barriers and critical success factors for implementing cloud data governance in the hope that it helps the reader to be aware of these barriers and consider them in future developments in the field.

However, there are not many papers that study this issue holistically and uncover the current state of this integration. Objective: This study sets out to answer the following research question: What is the current state of integration between agile processes and usability techniques? Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS). A SMS is a form of systematic literature review that aims to identify and classify the research papers published about a specified issue. Results: We retrieved a total of 31 primary studies, suggesting that the agile development community is starting to adopt some usability techniques in its development projects. Most of the human-computer interaction (HCI) techniques that the ASDP is adopting are techniques related to requirements engineering, especially techniques for requirements elicitation and analysis. Judging by the increase in the number of publications over the last decade, the integration of HCI activities and techniques into the ASDP is an issue of notable interest. Conclusions: There are few papers that study the literature holistically and report the current state of usability in the ASDP. Additionally, the literature does not contain a general, formal and systematic proposal to help agile development teams adopt usability techniques in their development projects. © 2016 IEEE.","Agile Software Development; Usability; Usability Techniques; User-centred Design","Data visualization; Human computer interaction; Integration; Requirements engineering; Software engineering; Usability engineering; User centered design; Agile software development; Agile software development process; Human computer interaction (HCI); Requirements elicitation; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping studies; Usability; Usability techniques; Software design",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509011476,,,"English","IEEE Int.

The results of this process are known to have key impact on the results of the project. As known from the experience in other fields and disciplines, visualization can potentially provide more insights into data, information and knowledge studied. While research in the area of information visualization and its application to software engineering has rapidly increased over the last decade, there is only a limited amount of studies addressing the usage and impact of visualization techniques for RE activities. In this paper, we report on the results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) related to RE visualization. Extending the established SLR process by the usage of grounded theory for the encoding of papers, we synthesize 18 usage patterns. Even though there are punctual applications, there is a clear deficit on a holistic perspective across the different RE activities.

Several researchers focus on the theory of teamwork organizations, based on academic performances, learning styles, learning settings, gender, etc. Therefore, grouping learners based on their predicted academic performance level in each subject separately may be more effective in a collaborative learning environment, but it still a challenging subject. First of all, we present in this paper a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the relevant studies that address the problem of predicting academic performance and to extract the used data mining methods such as Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, etc. At the beginning, a set of 658 papers were selected. After applying the different SLR's steps, this selection has been filtered to 12 papers using specific selection criteria and a careful analysis of each paper. Then, the selected studies were used to answer the defined research questions. Finally, synthesis data, current research gaps and recommendations for further work are discussed in this paper. © 2016 IEEE.","Collaborative learning; Data mining; E-learning; Systematic literature review; Teamwork","Complex networks; Computer aided instruction; Data mining; Decision trees; E-learning; Education; Engineering education; Trees (mathematics); Academic performance; Collaborative learning; Collaborative learning environment; Predicting academic performance; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Teamwork; Time-consuming tasks; Learning systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509007783,,,"English","Int.

This is due to characteristics of this type of systems, such as the high number of configurations and runtime adaptations. In this context, the characterisation of challenges for testing ASs may support the definition of suitable testing strategies. However, such characterisation is currently spread over several studies in the literature. Objective: analysing testing-related challenges for ASs which are described in the literature, and establishing a generic classification. Method: we extended a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of studies that address challenges for AS testing. By analysing the combined results (original and extended), we mapped descriptions found in individual studies, based on their similarities, in order to create a list of generic challenges. Results: a list of 12 generic challenges based on 34 specific ones described by several authors. Additionally, we analysed the relationship between the challenges and inherent properties of ASs. Conclusion: different terminology, varied levels of details and particular contexts (e.g. specific AS implementations) are recurring problems related to the characterisation of challenges for testing ASs. Generalisations such as the one proposed in this work may help researchers and practitioners do devise customised testing strategies that focus in recurring, inherent properties of ASs.

Whenever new evidence is published after the completion of a SLR, this SLR should be updated in order to preserve its value. However, updating SLRs involves significant effort. Objective: The goal of this paper is to investigate the application of forward snowballing to support the update of SLRs. Method: We compare outcomes of an update achieved using the forward snowballing versus a published update using the search-based approach, i.e., searching for studies in electronic databases using a search string. Results: Forward snowballing showed a higher precision and a slightly lower recall. It reduced in more than five times the number of primary studies to filter however missed one relevant study. Conclusions: Due to its high precision, we believe that the use of forward snowballing considerably reduces the effort in updating SLRs in Software Engineering; however the risk of missing relevant papers should not be underrated. © 2016 ACM.","forward snowballing; Systematic literature reviews","Software engineering; Electronic database; forward snowballing; High-precision; Research questions; Search-based; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Precision engineering",,,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,9781450344272,,,"English","Int.

It must evolve over time in order to meet different changes in its environment, satisfy the developers' needs, and adapt to new requirements. Software developers and team members face difficulties tracking the changes others made to their software. Software visualization is one of the effective techniques that help stakeholders to better understand how software evolves, and which parts of the software are most affected by the change. Many visualization tools and techniques have been introduced by researchers and organizations to facilitate such understanding. Method: This articIe presents a systematic literature review (SLR) on software evolution visualization (SEV) tools. The SLR's main focus is to: (1) explore the main target of SEV, (2) analyze the c1assifications and taxonomies that are used to represent SEV tools, and (3) find out wh at are the main sources of information used to visualize software's evolution. Result: 29 papers were analyzed out of 55 papers. The result showed that SEV tools can be cIassified into five different groups: graph-based, notation-based, matrix-based, and metaphor-based and others. Graph-based are most popular while Notation-based are the least. SEVs focus can be either Artifact-centric visualization, Metric-centric visualization, Feature-centric visualization, or Architecture-centric visualization. The main source of information used to ex-tract information are the software repositories. ConcIusion: This work can help developer, maintainer, research er to get good knowledge about the state of software evolution and visualization as a whole. © 2016 IEEE.","CVS; Evolution; History; Repository; SEV; Software; Systematic Literature Review (SLR); Tools; Visualization","Flow visualization; Graphic methods; History; Tools; Visualization; Architecture-centric; Evolution; Repository; Software repositories; Software visualization; Sources of informations; Systematic literature review (SLR); Visualization technique; Computer software",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467389136,,,"English","Proc. - CSIT: Int.

There are different architectural approaches for implementing CDSS. Some of these approaches are based on cloud computing, which provides on-demand computing resources over internet. The goal of this paper is to determine and discuss key issues and approaches involving architectural designs in implementing a CDSS using cloud computing. To this end, we performed a standard Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of primary studies showing the intervention of cloud computing on CDSS implementations. Twenty-one primary studies were reviewed. We found that CDSS architectural components are similar in most of studies. Cloud-based CDSS are most used in Home Healthcare and Emergency Medical Systems. Alerts/Reminders and Knowledge Service are the most common implementations. Major challenges are around security, performance and compatibility. We concluded on the benefits of implementing a cloud-based CDSS, since it allows cost-efficient, ubiquitous and elastic computing resources. We highlight that some studies show weaknesses regarding the conceptualization of a cloud-based computing approach and lack of a formal methodology in the architectural design process. © 2016 IEEE.","clinical decision support systems; cloud computing; e-health; health care; software architecture; systematic review","Architectural design; Artificial intelligence; Cloud computing; Distributed computer systems; Health care; Software architecture; Ubiquitous computing; Architectural approach; Architectural components; Clinical decision support systems; Cloud based computing; E health; Emergency Medical system; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Decision support systems",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781509009435,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

In the recent decade, Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was becoming an increasingly important empirical research method in SE. One of the mechanisms of insuring the level of scientific value in the findings of an SLR is to rigorously assess its validity. Hence, it is necessary to realize the status quo and issues of TTVs of SLRs in SE. Objective: This study aims to investigate thestate-of-the-practice of TTVs of the SLRs published in SE, and further support SE researchers to improve the assessment and strategies against TTVs in order to increase the quality of SLRs in SE. Method: We conducted a tertiary study by reviewing the SLRs in SE that report the assessment of TTVs. Results: We identified 316 SLRs published from 2004 to the first half of 2015, in which TTVs are discussed. The issues associated to TTVs were also summarized and categorized. Conclusion: The common TTVs related to SLR research, such as internal validity and reliability, were thoroughly discussed in most SLRs. The threats to construct validity and external validity drew less attention. Moreover, there are few strategies and tactics being reported to cope with the various TTVs. © 2016 IEEE.","Evidence-Based Software Engineering; Systematic (Literature) Review; Threats to Validity","Construct validity; Empirical research method; Empirical studies; Evidence Based Software Engineering; External validities; Systematic (literature) review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Threats to Validity; Software engineering",,"Potanin A.Murphy G.C.Reeves S.Dietrich J.","IEEE Computer Society",15301362,9781509055753,,,"English","Proc.

A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) is a form of a SLR which includes grey literature in addition to the published (formal) literature. Only a few MLRs have been published in SE so far. We aim at raising the awareness for MLRs in SE by addressing two research questions (RQs): (1) What types of knowledge are missed when a SLR does not include the multivocal literature in a SE field? and (2) What do we, as a community, gain when we include the multivocal literature and conduct MLRs? To answer these RQs, we sample a few example SLRs and MLRs and identify the missing and the gained knowledge due to excluding or including the grey literature. We find that (1) grey literature can give substantial benefits in certain areas of SE, and that (2) the inclusion of grey literature brings forward certain challenges as evidence in them is often experience and opinion based. Given these conflicting viewpoints, the authors are planning to prepare systematic guidelines for performing MLRs in SE. © 2016 ACM.","Empirical software engineering; Grey literature; MLR; Multivocal Literature Reviews; Research methodology; SLR; Systematic literature reviews","Computer applications; Computer programming; Empirical Software Engineering; Grey literature; Literature reviews; Research methodologies; Systematic literature review; Software engineering",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450336918,,,"English","ACM Int.

Cost avoidance captures benefits that are not captured by cost savings e.g. spending that would have increased in the absence of the cost avoidance activity. This type of benefit can be combined with quality aspects of the product e.g. costs avoided because of defect prevention. Cost avoidance is a key driver for software reuse. Objectives: The main objectives of this study are: (1) To assess the status of capturing cost avoidance through reuse in the academia; (2) Based on the first objective, propose improvements in capturing of reuse cost avoidance, integrate these into an instrument, and evaluate the instrument in the software industry. Method: The study starts with a systematic literature review (SLR) on capturing of cost avoidance through reuse. Later, a solution is proposed and evaluated in the industry to address the shortcomings identified during the systematic literature review. Results: The results of a systematic literature review describe three previous studies on reuse cost avoidance and show that no solution, to capture reuse cost avoidance, was validated in industry. Afterwards, an instrument and a data collection form are proposed that can be used to capture the cost avoided by reusing any type of reuse artefact. The instrument and data collection form (describing guidelines) were demonstrated to a focus group, as part of static evaluation. Based on the feedback, the instrument was updated and evaluated in industry at 6 development sites, in 3 different countries, covering 24 projects in total. Conclusion: The proposed solution performed well in industrial evaluation. With this solution, practitioners were able to do calculations for reuse costs avoidance and use the results as decision support for identifying potential artefacts to reuse. © 2016 ACM.","Cost avoidance; Cost savings; Software reuse","Costs; Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Software engineering; Cost avoidances; Cost saving; Decision supports; Defect prevention; Industrial evaluations; Software organisations; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Computer software reusability",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450336918,,,"English","ACM Int.

Depending on the number of identified primary studies, the selection activity can be very time-consuming and a strategy, like SCAS, to semi-automate this activity can be helpful. Objective: To present an experimental study carried out to evaluate the SCAS strategy. Method: We conducted an experiment to compare the efficiency and effectiveness between participants using SCAS and the manual approach. They received necessary training for applying SCAS using tool support. They were divided into five groups, which conducted SRs based on their research areas. Results: When applying SCAS, the average effort reduction was 22.33%, and the average percentage error was 3.95% with a minimal loss of 1.6 evidence per SR. In addition, results showed an overall precision of 65.49% on an overall recall of 90.24% when using SCAS. The overall Kappa showed that there is a substantial agreement level between the groups and SCAS. Conclusion: The experiment increased the confidence in the strategy, reinforcing that it can reduce the effort required to select primary studies without adversely affecting the overall results of SRs. © 2016 ACM.","Evidence-based software engineering (EBSE); Experiment; Primary study selection activity; Score Citation Automatic Selection (SCAS); StArt tool; Systematic literature review (SLR)","Computer applications; Computer programming; Experiments; Automatic selection; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Percentage error; Rigorous methodologies; Study selection activities; Systematic literature review (SLR); Systematic Review; Tool support; Software engineering",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450336918,,,"English","ACM Int.

Job Rotation is an organizational practice whereby individuals are regularly moved among jobs or projects in the same organization. Goal: To identify and discuss evidence about job rotation, in order to understand the use, the benefits, and the limitations of this practice in software organizations. Method: A systematic literature review protocol was used to identify and select empirical studies previously published in the software engineering literature, and then coding techniques were used to analyse and synthesize their findings. Results: This review identified 18 empirical papers presenting evidence of 17 distinct studies about job rotation in software engineering. These studies revealed that in software organizations job rotation has been used to enhance communication, organizational understanding, knowledge exchange, and task variety. However, its use also requires extra effort and sometimes complex planning. Conclusion: The research about job rotation in software engineering is restricted, with only one study focusing on this topic and 16 presenting non-intentional evidence about the theme. Our review synthesized evidence that could inform research and practice. However, due to the specific nature of software development tasks and jobs, empirical evidence is still needed to guide the effective application of job rotation in practice.

The aim of this work is to present the characterization of requirements elicitation processes proposed in recent years, through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). This kind of characterization is important, once it can assist companies wishing to adopt an elicitation process. Furthermore, the categorization of existing processes will assist in their dissemination and consolidation.","Requirements elicitation process; Systematic literature review","Information systems; Requirements engineering; Common knowledge; Requirements analysis; Requirements elicitation; Software requirements; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Distributed computer systems",,"Cappelli C.Vilain P.Wazlawick R.S.Siqueira F.A.","Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis - UFSC/Departamento de Informatica e Estatistica",,9788576693178,,,"Portuguese","SBSI - Braz.

The results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) show that there are different ways to carry out Agile RE approaches, what increases heterogeneity among them. This thesis studies how a commonly accepted framework for Agile RE looks like. To this end, the initial phase for creating a methodology based on a pattern approach will be performed. Therefore, the design science research methodology is applied to carry out the research. The designed artifact is a metamodel that describes the Agile RE process at an abstract level.

The industry and geographical focus is on the manufacturing sector and Southwest Germany, respectively. Against this background, especially the sophisticated technical consumer goods and investment goods contribute greatly to the competitive advantage of the region as a whole. The contribution combines considerations of different theories and examines the field from multiple angles: (1) regions and factories as systems, (2) proximity, (3) competitive advantage. A systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is applied in order to substantiate each of the three pillars. The work results in a set of characteristics describing requirements for an analytical framework or management model in order to successfully shape a regions future by the systematic identification and leverage of efficiency potentials. The scope of action is the extended regional infrastructure, which comprises elements of various systems, such as economy, politics, administration, and science. It is argued that the different systems, as well as their subsystems (e.g. organizations within the economic or scientific sector), have to be recognized as generally independent and self-organized. Therefore, a key task is related to the coordination of systems which can be understood as the formation and configuration of a structural coupling. © 2016 The Authors.","Complex Social Systems; Efficiency Potentials; Extended Regional Infrastructure; Literature Review","Competition; Complex networks; Economics; Efficiency; Investments; Competitive advantage; Complex social systems; Literature reviews; Manufacturing sector; Regional infrastructure; Structural coupling; Systematic identification; Systematic literature review (SLR); Manufacture","Kuch, B.; Graduate School of Excellence Advanced Manufacturing Engineering (GSaME), University of Stuttgart, Allmandring 35, Germany; email: benjamin.kuch@gsame.uni-stuttgart.de","Bauernhansl T.Westkamper E.","Elsevier B.V.",22128271,,,,"English","Procedia CIRP",Conference Paper,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006974344

One reason for the popularity of big data research is the knowledge that can be extracted from analyzing these large data sets. However, data can contain sensitive information, and data must therefore be sufficiently protected as it is stored and processed. Furthermore, it might also be required to provide meaningful, proven, privacy guarantees if the data can be linked to individuals. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no systematic overview of the overlap between big data and the area of security and privacy. Consequently, this review aims to explore security and privacy research within big data, by outlining and providing structure to what research currently exists. Moreover, we investigate which papers connect security and privacy with big data, and which categories these papers cover. Ultimately, is security and privacy research for big data different from the rest of the research within the security and privacy domain? To answer these questions, we perform a systematic literature review (SLR), where we collect recent papers from top conferences, and categorize them in order to provide an overview of the security and privacy topics present within the context of big data. Within each category we also present a qualitative analysis of papers representative for that specific area. Furthermore, we explore and visualize the relationship between the categories. Thus, the objective of this review is to provide a snapshot of the current state of security and privacy research for big data, and to discover where further research is required. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Data mining; Data privacy; Paper; Hot research topics; Large datasets; Qualitative analysis; Security and privacy; Sensitive informations; Specific areas; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Big data",,"Ak R.Karypis G.Xia Y.Hu X.T.Yu P.S.Joshi J.Ungar L.Liu L.Sato A.-H.Suzumura T.Rachuri S.Govindaraju R.Xu W.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467390040,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

We hypothesize that inspections focused on identifying errors (i.e., root cause of faults) are better at finding requirements faults when compared to inspection methods that rely on checklists created using lessons-learned from historical fault-data. Our previous work verified that, error based inspections guided by an initial requirements errors taxonomy (RET) performed significantly better than standard fault-based inspections. However, RET lacked an underlying human information processing model grounded in Cognitive Psychology research. The current research reports results from a systematic literature review (SLR) of Software Engineering and Cognitive Science literature - Human Error Taxonomy (HET) that contains requirements phase human errors. The major contribution of this paper is a report of control group study that compared the fault detection effectiveness and usefulness of HET with the previously validated RET. Results of this study show that subjects using HET were not only more effective at detecting faults, but they found faults faster. Post-hoc analysis of HET also revealed meaningful insights into the most commonly occurring human errors at different points during requirements development. The results provide motivation and feedback for further refining HET and creating formal inspection tools based on HET.","Empirical study; Human error; Requirements inspection; Taxonomy","Bionics; Computer software selection and evaluation; Fault detection; Inspection; Knowledge engineering; Software engineering; Systematic errors; Taxonomies; Cognitive psychology; Empirical investigation; Empirical studies; Fault detection effectiveness; High-quality software; Human errors; Human information-processing model; Systematic literature review (SLR); Errors",,,"Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School",23259000,189170639X; 9781891706394,,,"English","Proc.

And if, in addition, the effort estimations are accurate, they can contribute a lot to the success of a project being developed. There are many approaches and methods available for performing effort estimation, each one with their own features, as well as pros and cons.

GSD aims at delivering remarkable software through a widely distributed pool of experts, with reduced efforts, minimum cost and time. In recent years, GSD developers have reshaped the development processes and have adopted agile techniques and green engineering principles to cope with the frequent changes in requirements, accelerate the development in short increments and to produce energy efficient and sustainable software. However, the adoption of agile methods for developing sustainable software possesses a number of challenges. This paper presents a list of potential challenges/risks identified through systematic literature review (SLR) that need to be avoided by the GSD vendors using agile methods for the development of green and sustainable software. Our findings reveal eight risk factors that are faced by GSD vendors in the development of green and sustainable software using agile methods. GSD vendors are encouraged to address properly all the identified factors in general and the most-frequently cited critical risks in particular, such as in-sufficient system documentation, limited support for real-time systems and large systems, management overhead, lack of customer's presence, lack of formal communication and lack of long term planning.

The objective is to investigate the strategic plan or guideline on how to develop and implement an effective collaborative knowledge management system (KMS) in order to ease the decision making process. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method is used to produce a strategic searching method to select, extract, review and discuss relevant studies concerning the research subject by adapting the guidelines established by [11]. A total of 12 previous studies carried out from 2010 till 2014 have been selected to fulfil this objective through thorough selection. Finding shows that there is a very limited study focusing on the strategic implementation of a KMS to enhance the quality of knowledge services in a collaborative environment. Although there is an increase in the studies that recommended KMS guidelines or strategic planning, the proposed solution were mostly unverified or validated. Therefore, it has become a motivation to conduct a study to propose a Collaborative KMS Strategic Planning Model that can significantly enhance the quality of knowledge services in an organization. © 2015 IEEE.","collaborative knowledge management system strategic planning; knowledge management; knowledge management strategy; knowledge management system","Big data; Computer software; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Software engineering; Strategic planning; Collaborative environments; Collaborative knowledge management; Decision making process; Knowledge management strategy; Knowledge management system; Knowledge service; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Decision making",,"Zain J.M.Majid M.A.Ameedeen M.A.Arshah R.A.Azmi Z.R.M.Mustaffa Z.M.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467367226,,,"English","Int.

In this light we have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) to investigate which human factors impact agile projects and conducted a survey in software companies in order to verify their perceptions. Considering the SLR, we found 48 resulting studies where most cited human factors were: Communication (23 papers), Collaboration (6 papers) and Trust (8 papers). The survey was answered for 186 companies that consider communication the most important factor. So we conclude that Communication, Trust and Collaboration are important factors in projects using agile methods but others factors need to be more investigated due the perception of its value to the industry. © 2015 IEEE.","Agile Software Development; Human Factors; Systematic Literature Review.","Human engineering; Software design; Surveys; Agile methods; Agile software development; Agile softwares; Software company; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Software engineering",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467371537,,,"English","Proc. - Agil.

Alignment is a key factor for success in many software development projects. Aligned teams are capable of bringing collaboration and positive results to companies; whereas misalignment among developers can make a conflicted environment and even lead the project to failure. OBJECTIVE. To assist developers in an embedded software development company in their conceptual alignment regarding source code quality. METHOD. In the organizational context, plan and perform a series of studies such as surveys, systematic literature review (SLR), qualitative data analysis and focus group to support the identification of conceptual misalignments among developers and establish common terminology and guidance concerning source code quality. RESULTS. The results from a survey conducted in one company showed a conceptual misalignment among developers regarding the source code quality that was triggering continuous rework during software evolution activities. Through an SLR and a qualitative analysis of code snippets, a set of evidence-based coding guidelines for readability and understandability of source code were formulated. These guidelines were evaluated and used as an instrument for aligning source code perspectives during a focus group, showing their feasibility and adequacy to the company's context. CONCLUSIONS. The use of all contextual information observed-e.g. teams' locations, software development context, and time constraints-along with the information gathered during the industry-academia collaboration was particularly important to help us appropriately chose research methods to be used, and formulate evidence-based coding guidelines that matched the company's needs and expectations. Further evaluations have to be carried out to ensure the quality impact of some guidelines proposed before using them all over the company. © 2015 IEEE.","code quality; conceptual alignment; experimental studies; industry-academia collaboration","Alignment; Codes (symbols); Computer programming languages; Software design; Surveys; Code quality; Contextual information; experimental studies; Organizational context; Qualitative data analysis; Software development projects; Source code qualities; Systematic literature review (SLR); Quality control",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479919345,,,"English","Proc. - Int.

Sci. and Engineering, Vilnius University, Lithuania; Noll, J., Lero - The Irish Software Research Centre, University of Limerick, Ireland","Context: Global Software Engineering (GSE) has become the predominant form of software development for global companies and has given rise to a demand for students trained in GSE. In response, universities are developing courses and curricula around GSE and researchers have begun to disseminate studies of these new approaches. Problem: GSE differs from most other computer science fields, however, in that practice is inseparable from theory. As a result, educators looking to create GSE courses face a daunting task: integrating global practice into the local classroom. Aim: This study aims to ameliorate the very difficult task of teaching GSE by delineating the challenges and providing some recommendations for overcoming them. Method: To meet our aims we pose two research questions (""When teaching GSE to students in Higher Education, what are the (a) challenges, and (b) recommendations for addressing them"") and then conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to determine the answers to these questions. Our SLR follows a carefully designed and validated protocol. Results: We found 82 papers that addressed our research questions. Our findings indicate that in addition to the challenges posed by GSE in general, particular problems arise in educational situations. The majority of these challenges fall into the ""global distance"" category, though teamwork challenges and people issues (such as trust) also commonly arise. Organizational differences between institutions, differing skill sets between students in different locations, and varying cultural work norms, for example, all operate within educational settings in quite different ways than in professional development teams. Integrating cultural training, conducting teamwork exercises to build trust, and instructor monitoring of team communication are all examples of techniques that have been used successfully by educators according to our review Conclusion: Despite the severity of the challenges in GSE education, many institutions have successfully developed courses and curricula targeting GSE. Indeed, for each of the challenges we have identified in the literature there are numerous recommendations for overcoming them. Instructors can use the recommendations given in this study as a starting point to running successful GSE courses. © 2015 ACM.","Capstone; Global software development; Global software engineering; International collaboration; Open ended group project; Systematic literature review; Teaching and learning","Computer software; Education; Education computing; Engineering education; International cooperation; Personnel training; Societies and institutions; Software design; Software engineering; Students; Teaching; Capstone; Global software development; Global software engineering; International collaborations; Open-Ended Group Projects; Systematic literature review; Teaching and learning; Curricula",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,9781450341462,,,"English","ITiCSE-WGP - Proc.

However, stakeholders have little guidance for choosing fitting definitions and metrics for these quality properties, thus leading to potential misunderstandings. For example, cloud consumers and providers cannot negotiate reliable and quantitative service level objectives directly understood by each stakeholder. Objectives: Therefore, we examine existing definitions and metrics for these quality properties from the viewpoint of cloud consumers, cloud providers, and software architects with regard to commonly used concepts. Methods: We execute a systematic literature review (SLR), reproducibly collecting common concepts in definitions and metrics for scalability, elasticity, and efficiency. As quality selection criteria, we assess whether existing literature differentiates the three properties, exemplifies metrics, and considers typical cloud characteristics and cloud roles. Results: Our SLR yields 418 initial results from which we select 20 for in-depth evaluation based on our quality selection criteria. In our evaluation, we recommend concepts, definitions, and metrics for each property. Conclusions: Software architects can use our recommendations to analyze the quality of cloud computing applications.

While many relevant studies have been carried out to evaluate various capture-recapture models and estimators, there still lacks common understanding on the adoption status of the method in software engineering. It is necessary to systematically collect empirical evidence of Capture-recapture adoption hence form necessary under- standing on the method. Objective: This study aims to synthesize relevant primary studies on the adoption of capture-recapture method in soft- ware engineering, and try to identify possible gaps between the state-of-practice and the state-of-art so as to provide clues for future research. Method: By following the guidelines of Kitchenham, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review(SLR) on studies of the adoption of capture-recapture method in software en- gineering. Results: From 5 common digital libraries, we retrieved 506 published articles, among them 44 were identified as relevant primary studies. We identified 18 capture-recapture estima- tors under 4 basic models. Types of the currently existing studies as well as the relevant in uencing factors to adoption of the capture-recapture method are also discussed. Conclusion: Results show that there are no conclusive de- cisions on the best capture-recapture models and estimators. Besides, the number of inspectors and their capability to de- tect defects as well as the difficulty to detect defects are most critical in uencing factors.

However, to date there are no studies on the state of the practice in this area, focusing on similar issues to those investigated in the above-mentioned SLR. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to report on the state of the practice on effort estimation in ASD, focusing on a wide range of aspects such as the estimation techniques and effort predictors used, to name a few. Method: A survey was carried out using as instrument an on-line questionnaire answered by agile practitioners who have experience in effort estimation. Results: Data was collected from 60 agile practitioners from 16 different countries, and the main findings are: 1) Planning poker (63%), analogy (47%) and expert judgment (38%) are frequently practiced estimation techniques in ASD; 2) Story points is the most frequently (62%) employed size metric, used solo or in combination with other metrics (e.g., function points); 3) Team's expertise level and prior experience are most commonly used cost drivers; 4) 52% of the respondents believe that their effort estimates on average are under/over estimated by an error of 25% or more; 5) Most agile teams take into account implementation and testing activities during effort estimation; and 6) Estimation is mostly performed at sprint and release planning levels in ASD. Conclusions: Estimation techniques that rely on experts' subjective assessment are the ones used the most in ASD, with effort underestimation being the dominant trend. Further, the use of multiple techniques in combination and story points seem to present a positive association with estimation accuracy, and team-related cost drivers are the ones used by most agile teams. Finally, requirements and management related issues are perceived as the main reasons for inaccurate estimates.

The objective of this paper is to conduct the systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the most frequently used SN for reporting and analyzing the real-time events worldwide. Furthermore, we recognize the features and techniques used for mining the real-time events from SNs. To determine the literature related to event mining (EM) and SNs, the SLR process has been used. The SLR searching phase resulted 692 total studies from different online databases that went through three phases of screening, and finally 145 papers out of 692 were chosen to include in this SLR as per inclusion criteria and RQs. Based on the data analysis of the selected 145 studies, this paper has concluded that the Twitter microblogging SN is the most used SN to repot the events in textual format. The most common features used are n-gram and TF-IDF. Results also showed that support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) are the most frequently used techniques for SNEM.

The most recent guidelines for systematic mapping are from 2008. Since that time, many suggestions have been made of how to improve systematic literature reviews (SLRs). There is a need to evaluate how researchers conduct the process of systematic mapping and identify how the guidelines should be updated based on the lessons learned from the existing systematic maps and SLR guidelines. Objective To identify how the systematic mapping process is conducted (including search, study selection, analysis and presentation of data, etc.); to identify improvement potentials in conducting the systematic mapping process and updating the guidelines accordingly. Method We conducted a systematic mapping study of systematic maps, considering some practices of systematic review guidelines as well (in particular in relation to defining the search and to conduct a quality assessment). Results In a large number of studies multiple guidelines are used and combined, which leads to different ways in conducting mapping studies. The reason for combining guidelines was that they differed in the recommendations given. Conclusion The most frequently followed guidelines are not sufficient alone. Hence, there was a need to provide an update of how to conduct systematic mapping studies.

A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a research method used to identify the literature through the application of a rigorous protocol that ensures transparency of the process and increases validity of the work. While a SLR identifies and characterizes the literature, the next step to comprehensively understanding the research area is to synthesize the content of relevant previous work. There are many approaches to research synthesis including meta-analysis and meta-synthesis. Both analysis methods have the same constraint - they are limited by characteristics of the current literature. In organizational research, this presents a significant challenge due to the variety of disciplines typically participating in this research and the lack of consistency in reporting research findings. In addition, the literature in these fields tends to include both qualitative and quantitative studies, further complicating the synthesis. The purpose of this work is to define a meta-evaluation framework to integrate the findings obtained from a quantitative meta-analysis and qualitative meta-synthesis.

To cope with this business process variability, the proper management of process variants along the entire process lifecycle becomes crucial. Objective: The goal of this paper is to develop a fundamental understanding of business process variability. In particular, the paper will provide a framework for assessing and comparing process variability approaches and the support they provide for the different phases of the business process lifecycle (i.e., process analysis and design, configuration, enactment, diagnosis, and evolution). Method: We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) in order to discover how process variability is supported by existing approaches. Results: The SLR resulted in 63 primary studies which were deeply analyzed. Based on this analysis, we derived the VIVACE framework. VIVACE allows assessing the expressiveness of a process modeling language regarding the explicit specification of process variability. Furthermore, the support provided by a process-aware information system to properly deal with process model variants can be assessed with VIVACE as well. Conclusions: VIVACE provides an empirically-grounded framework for process engineers that enables them to evaluate existing process variability approaches as well as to select that variability approach meeting their requirements best. Finally, it helps process engineers in implementing PAISs supporting process variability along the entire process lifecycle. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Eye-trackers monitor participants' visual attention by collecting eye-movement data. These data are useful to get insights into participants' cognitive processes during reasoning tasks. Objective The Evidence-based Software Engineering (EBSE) paradigm has been proposed in 2004 and, since then, has been used to provide detailed insights regarding different topics in software engineering research and practice. Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) are also useful in the context of EBSE by bringing together all existing evidence of research and results about a particular topic. This SLR evaluates the current state of the art of using eye-trackers in software engineering and provides evidence on the uses and contributions of eye-trackers to empirical studies in software engineering. Method We perform a SLR covering eye-tracking studies in software engineering published from 1990 up to the end of 2014. To search all recognised resources, instead of applying manual search, we perform an extensive automated search using Engineering Village. We identify 36 relevant publications, including nine journal papers, two workshop papers, and 25 conference papers. Results The software engineering community started using eye-trackers in the 1990s and they have become increasingly recognised as useful tools to conduct empirical studies from 2006. We observe that researchers use eye-trackers to study model comprehension, code comprehension, debugging, collaborative interaction, and traceability. Moreover, we find that studies use different metrics based on eye-movement data to obtain quantitative measures. We also report the limitations of current eye-tracking technology, which threaten the validity of previous studies, along with suggestions to mitigate these limitations. Conclusion However, not withstanding these limitations and threats, we conclude that the advent of new eye-trackers makes the use of these tools easier and less obtrusive and that the software engineering community could benefit more from this technology. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Experiment; Eye-tracking; Software engineering","Behavioral research; Cognitive systems; Data reduction; Experiments; Software engineering; Collaborative interaction; Engineering community; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Eye tracking technologies; Eye-tracking; Quantitative measures; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Eye movements","Sharafi, Z.; Ptidej Team, Départment de Génie Informatique et Génie Logiciel, Polytechnique MontréalCanada",,"Elsevier",09505849,,ISOTE,,"English","Inf Software Technol",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942013015

Over the last few years, the role of replication in software engineering (SE), families of experiments and the need to aggregate the results of groups of experiments have attracted special attention. Frameworks, taxonomies, processes, recommendations and guidelines for reporting replications have been proposed to support the replication of SE experiments. There has been much less debate about the issue of the joint analysis of replications whose raw data are available to experimenters. Objectives: The aim of our research is to explore current trends in the joint analysis of SE experiments whose raw data are available to experimenters. Notice that the fact that experimenters have access to the raw data is what differentiates joint analysis from other methods for aggregating experimental results (e.g. systematic literature review (SLR), where the applicability of meta-analysis techniques is widely accepted). The objective of this three-year investigation is to shed light on the best joint analysis approach when the experimenters have access to raw data from several replications. Method: Narrative comparison, standard frequentist methods, meta-analysis and Bayesian methods have been used in SE literature. We will apply and evaluate each approach to the experiments on Test-Driven Development (TDD) carried out within the Experimental Software Engineering Industrial Laboratory (ESEIL) project. We will propose and rate a tentative framework for aggregating results within the ESEIL project. The proposed framework, as well as the different existing methods, will be evaluated on another set of replications of testing technique experiments. Current status: The thesis proposal was elicited on the 15 January 2015 and rounded out over the following six months.

The implementation of E-government differs from country to country and is associated with a number of challenges for public administrators. Cloud computing is widely proposed as a solution to enhance the development of E-government. Previously, we have conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify essential factors that influence the adoption of cloud computing for E-government implementation in developing countries. In this paper, we present a quantitative study involving 234 IT experts to confirm the significance of the identified factors. SPSS along with AMOS is employed to analyze the data. Confirmatory factor analysis, measurement model and structural model are executed. Findings indicate that the following factors significantly influence the adoption of cloud computing for E-government implementation in Iraq: complexity, compatibility, top management support, relative advantage, IT knowledge and security. The results show that trust and technology readiness have no significant influence on E-government implementation via cloud computing. On a wider perspective, non-technological factors require more attention than technological factors. This review will be useful to decision makers in governments and public sectors that intend to leverage cloud computing to overcome the challenges they face in implementing e-Government successfully. © 2015 IEEE.","cloud computing; critical factors; E-government; TOE","Cloud computing; Decision making; Developing countries; Distributed computer systems; Factor analysis; Information use; Confirmatory factor analysis; Critical factors; E-government implementation; E-governments; Information and Communication Technologies; Public service deliveries; Systematic literature review (SLR); Top management support; Government data processing",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781467395724,,,"English","IEEE Stud.

A web site is the main source that provides users' needs. However, some of the existing web sites are not well intentioned by users. Many studies have treated the problem of assessing the web sites' quality of different categories such as ecommerce, education, entertainment, health, etc. The problematic implies a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) due to the multiple conflicting criteria for assessment. Existing methods are mainly based on making a hierarchy to divide high level criteria, sub-level criteria and alternatives. There is no standard until now that defines important criteria for evaluation. Indeed, this paper presents a process of collecting and extracting data from a list of studies according to a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method. In fact, it is necessary to know frequent criteria used in the literature for establishing the task of assessment. This paper proposes also a determination of an association rules' set extracted from a set of criteria by applying an Apriori method. © 2014 IEEE.","Assessing Web Sites; Association rules; Multiple Criteria; Systematic Literature Review","Association rules; Decision making; Intelligent systems; Social networking (online); Apriori; Criteria for evaluations; Multiple criteria; Multiple criteria decision making; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Websites","Rekik, R.; REGIM-Lab, Research Groups in Intelligent Machines, University of Sfax, BP 1173, Tunisia; email: rim.rekik@ieee.org",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479976331,,,"English","Int.

Today, network survivability analysis is an essential aspect of reliable communication especially in MANETs. Although various methods have been proposed to model network survivability analysis in MANETs, no related review has been published as to date for this topic. Thus, a comprehensive review of this body of work would be beneficial to researchers to have an overview of the current state of research trend in this area. This paper provides a systematic literature review (SLR) of the state of the art approach in modeling network survivability analysis in MANETs. We used studies from a number of relevant article sources, and our results showed the existence of twenty six articles. From this SLR we found that the existing of modeling method is focusing on individual node in which the node is treated as independent event. Furthermore, the analysis also reveals the less popular methods in modeling network survivability analysis are with statistical methods such as regression analysis and survival analysis. The implication of this study is to give a clear direction to future researchers in this area for a better and accurate analysis in measuring network survivability in MANETs. © 2014 IEEE.","MANETs; Network survivability; Systematic Literature Review","Mobile security; Regression analysis; Wireless telecommunication systems; MANETs; Network survivability; Reliable communication; State of research; State-of-the-art approach; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Wireless technologies; Mobile ad hoc networks",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479981151,,,"English","Congr.

SNs has been used by millions of people around the world for sharing thoughts and daily life events on many topics, either it is political, crisis, Peace building (Pb). The objective of this paper is to get insight of Pb Event Mining (EM) from SNs (e.g., Tweets, Fb posts, etc) by conducting the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) process. The paper aims to answer some research questions (RQs) that includes, 1) Which SN's has been widely used for Textual Pb Event Mining PbEM?, 2) What Context or setting has been focussed of PbEM studies and how to categorize Pb events?, and 3) What other types of events (non-Pb) are reported? The SLR process has been used to identify the related literature and for analysis of evidences in order to answer the RQs. This paper concluded on the basis of SLR studies that the 'Twitter' is widely used SN for Textual PbEM because 54 out of 64 studies on PbEM uses Twitter. SLR resulted that earth quake (EQ) events are the major concerned events that effect country's economy and peace therefore most of studies uses the EQ as context/setting.

Currently, SLR authors must perform the dificult, time-consuming task in largely manual fashion. To identify barriers faced by SLR authors, we conducted an interactive community workshop prior to ESEM'13. Workshop participants generated a total of 100 ideas that, through group discussions, formed 37 composite barriers to the SLR process. Further analysis reveals the barriers relate to latent themes regarding the SLR process, primary studies, the practitioner community, and tooling. This paper describes the barriers identified during the workshop along with a ranking of those barriers that is based on votes by workshop attendees. The paper concludes by describing the impact of these barriers on three important constituencies: SLR Methodology Researchers, SLR Authors and SLR consumers.

However, SLR is not enough, if the study is oriented towards comparing technologies or tools solutions. This paper presents a mechanism to be applied systematically in surveys and comparative studies of tools and technological solutions. It is based on general concepts defined in SLR, but it extends them in order to cover other necessities. The paper illustrates how this mechanism is applied to a real project named THOT and it offers conclusions and learned lessons from the last trends.","Comparative studies; Enterprise content management; Surveys; Systematic literature reviews","Formal methods; Surveying; Comparative studies; Enterprise content managements; Enterprise environment; Research environment; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Technical tools; Technological solution; Surveys",,"Linger H.Vrcek N.Lang M.Barry C.Schneider C.Vukovac D.P.Strahonja V.","University of Zagreb, Faculty of Organization and Informatics Varazdin",,9789536071432,,,"English","Inf.

The idea behind SPL management is to focus on artifacts that are shared in order to support software reuse and adaptation. Gains are expected in terms of time to market, consistency across products, costs reduction, better flexibility, and better management of change requirements. In this context, there are many available options of SPL variability management tools. This paper presents and discusses the findings from a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of SPL management tools. Our research method aimed at analyzing the available literature on SPL management tools and the involved experts in the field. This review provides insights (i) to support companies interested to choose a tool for SPL variability management that best fits their needs; (ii) to point out attributes and requirements relevant to those interested in developing new tools; and (iii) to help the improvement of the tools already available. As a direct result of this SLR, we identify gaps, such as the lack of industrial support during product configuration. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.","Software product lines; Systematic literature review; Tools; Variability management","Empowerment of personnel; Software design; Tools; Management of change; Product configuration; Software Product Line; Software product line engineerings; Software product lines; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Variability management; Computer software reusability","Pereira, J.A.; Computer Science Department, Federal University of Minas GeraisBrazil","Schaefer I.Stamelos I.","Springer Verlag",03029743,9783319141299,,,"English","Lect.

[Method] We applied the same methodology used in the SLR we are extending herein (covering the period 2006-2013) based on primary studies that compared predictions from cross-company models with predictions from within-company models constructed from analysis of project data. [Results] We identified 11 additional papers; however two of these did not present independent results and one had inconclusive findings. Two of the remaining eight papers presented both, trials where cross-company predictions were not significantly different from within-company predictions and others where they were significantly different. Four found that cross-company models gave prediction accuracy significantly different from within-company models (one of them in favor of cross-company models), while two found no significant difference. The main pattern when examining the study related factors was that studies where cross-company predictions were significantly different from within-company predictions employed larger within-company data sets. [Conclusions] Overall, half of the analyzed evidence indicated that cross-company estimation models are not significantly worse than within-company estimation models. Moreover, there is some evidence that sample size does not imply in higher estimation accuracy, and that samples for building estimation models should be carefully selected/filtered based on quality control and project similarity aspects. The results need to be combined with the findings from the SLR we are extending to allow further investigating this topic.

Agile models such as Scrum and XP are suited to the knowledge intensive domain of game development where innovation and speed to market are vital.

Unfortunately, valuable knowledge collected in the SLR process is publicly available only to a limited extent, which considerably slows down building BoKs incrementally. [Objective] In this paper, we introduce the Systematic Knowledge Engineering (SKE) process to support building up BoKs from empirical studies efficiently. [Method] SKE is based on the SLR process and on Knowledge Engineering (KE) practices to provide a Knowledge Base (KB) with semantic technologies that enable reusing intermediate data extraction results and querying of empirical evidence. We evaluated SKE by building a software inspection EMSE BoK KB from knowledge acquired by controlled experiments. We elicited relevant queries from EMSE researchers and systematically integrated information from 30 representative research papers into the KB. [Results] The resulting KB was effective in answering the queries, enabling knowledge reuse for analyses beyond the results from the SLR process. [Conclusion] SKE showed promising results in the software inspection context and should be evaluated in other contexts for building EMSE BoKs faster.

In order to guarantee the correct interoperability of such systems, with respect to functional and non-functional requirements, integration testing is an effective measure to achieve this. Model-based testing moreover not only enables early definition and validation, but also test automation. This makes it a good choice to overcome urgent challenges of integration testing. Objective: Many publications on model-based integration testing (MBIT) approaches can be found. Nevertheless, a study giving a systematic overview on the underlying software paradigms, measures for guiding the integration testing process as well as non-functional requirements they are suitable for, is missing. The aim of this paper is to find and synthesize the relevant primary studies to gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of model-based integration testing. Method: For synthesizing the relevant studies, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) according to the guidelines of Kitchenham. Results: The systematic search and selection retrieved 83 relevant studies from which data has been extracted. Our review identified three assessment criteria for guiding the testing process, namely static metrics, dynamic metrics and stochastic &random. In addition it shows that just a small fraction considers non-functional requirements. Most approaches are for component-oriented systems. Conclusion: Results from the SLR show that there are two major research gaps. First, there is an accumulated need for approaches in the MBIT field that support non-functional requirements, as they are gaining importance. Second, means for steering the integration testing process, especially together with automation, need to evolve.

As an important research methodology in evidence-based software engineering, systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are used for identifying the evidence and critically appraising the evidence, i.e. empirical studies that report (empirical) data about specific research questions. The 80/20 Rule (or Pareto's Law) reveals a 'vital few' phenomenon widely observed in many disciplines in the last century. However, the applicability of Pareto's Law to evidence distribution in software engineering (SE) is never tested yet. The objective of this paper is to investigate the applicability of Pareto's Law to the evidence distribution on specific topic areas in software engineering (in the form of systematic reviews), which may help us better understand the possible distribution of evidence in software engineering, and further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of literature search. We performed a tertiary study of SLRs in software engineering dated between 2004 and 2012. We further tested the Pareto's Law by collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the distribution (over publication venues) of the primary studies reported in the existing SLRs. Our search identified 255 SLRs, 107 of which were included according to the selection criteria. The analysis of the extracted data from these SLRs presents a preliminary view of the evidence (study) distribution in software engineering. The nonuniform distribution of evidence is supported by the data from the existing SLRs in SE. However, the present observation reflects a weaker 'vital few' relation between study and venue than the 80/20 Rule statement. Top referenced venues are suggested when researchers search for studies in software engineering. It is also noticeable to the community that the primary studies are improperly or incompletely reported in many SLRs. © 2014 ACM.","evidence distribution; evidence-based software engineering; Pareto's Law (80/20 Rule); systematic (literature) review","Pareto principle; Research; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Evidence Based Software Engineering; evidence distribution; Non-uniform distribution; Pareto's Law (80/20 Rule); Research methodologies; Research questions; Systematic (literature) review; Software engineering",,,"Association for Computing Machinery",,9781450329651,,,"English","ACM Int.

A decade ago, Kitchenham, Dyb and Jørgensen argued that software engineering could benefit from an evidence-based research approach similar that that used in medicine, introducing the basis for Evidence Based Software Engineering (EBSE). Objective. Our main goal is to understand the evolution of the use of systematic reviews as the main research method in EBSE, as proposed by Kitchenham et al., by investigating primary and tertiary studies that explore any aspect, theory, or concept around the use of systematic reviews in software engineering. Method. A systematic mapping study protocol was used to find and selected studies about EBSE and systematic reviews in SE, published between 2004 and 2013. Results. We selected 52 unique papers classified as non-empirical studies (12), empirical studies (31), and tertiary studies (9). Conclusion. SLR has become an important component of software engineering research with nearly 200 unique reviews catalogued by the tertiary studies.

In order to correctly estimate, it is necessary to have a broad knowledge of the factors that influence effort estimation in Web projects. Aim: In this research we aim to increase the understanding of Web effort estimation by using a set of factors identified in literature along with the knowledge from experts in effort estimation. Method: We have gathered data from two different sources: (a) our previous work, in which we applied Grounded Theory procedures to identify factors that influence Web effort estimation from the point of view of Web project estimation experts; and (b) a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) extension, in which we identified factors reported in research papers. We have used the qualitative results from these sources to make comparisons and draw conclusions on factors affecting Web effort estimation. Results: We identified a total of 90 factors that influence effort estimation in Web projects. From this set, 30 factors were identified only in the qualitative study with experts in effort estimation, not being present in the SLR extension. Conclusions: By integrating the factors found in both our qualitative study with effort estimation experts and the SLR extension, we managed to create a comprehensive list of factors influencing effort estimation. Also, this set can be a starting point in the proposal of effort estimation models. Finally, the results from our comparison can be considered an indication that it is necessary to increase the employment of qualitative research to capture evidences regarding the current state of practice in Software Engineering.

Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate this subject. Results: The review identified 34 primary studies and 10 simulators. Conclusions: The findings show that this is a continuous research area and SPS game appears more attractive to education than non-game SPS. In contrast, only one study on non-game SPS in education was reported after 2005. SimSE was identified as a landmark among the simulators for SEE in the past years. © 2014 Authors.","simulation game; software engineering education; software process simulation; systematic literature review","Process simulations; Simulation games; Software process simulation; Systematic literature review; Software engineering","Jiang, S.; Software Institute, Nanjing UniversityChina",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,9781450327749,,,"English","Int.

Newer technologies like SOA, BPM and Cloud demand different perspectives and newer tools and techniques to support impact analysis and propagation in distributed environments. SOA adoption is fairly recent and major concern is now shifting towards maintenance and evolution of the service based business Process management systems. Change impact analysis and propagation have been identified as a potential research area in this context. This study is part of a larger study to systematically review all available research on impact analysis and propagation in context of Business process management (BPM) and Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Preliminary results have been reported by answering 2 selected research Questions. 43 studies were selected out of initial set of 182 research articles. Studies answering selected research questions have been included in this report. BPM is considered at Business Level for Business operations and Process Models, while SOA is considered as a Deployment Architecture at service level. We have extended the scope of our study to Inter-Process and inter-service change analysis in addition to Top-Down, Bottom-Up analysis. This study revealed that although evolution of service based systems is getting significant attention, very few approaches and tools exist to support impact analysis and propagation activities. © 2014 IEEE.","BPM; Change Propagation; CIA; Dependency Analysis; SOA; systematic literature review (SLR); Web Services","Administrative data processing; Application programs; Enterprise resource management; Information services; Software engineering; Web services; World Wide Web; BPM; Change propagation; CIA; Dependency analysis; SOA; Systematic literature review (SLR); Service oriented architecture (SOA)",,"Jawawi D.N.A.Sulaiman S.Mohamad R.Sa'Adon N.A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781479954391,,,"English","Malays.

In MBT, test cases can be derived from different models, also from the popularly used UML diagrams. Different UML diagrams include various important pieces of information that can be successfully used in a testing procedure. A lot of papers present approaches for test case generation from different UML diagrams and researchers are trying to find the most optimal one. In this paper, we present the first results of a systematic literature review in the area of test case generation from UML diagrams. Based on research questions, we explored which UML diagrams are most commonly used for test case generation, what approaches are presented in the literature, their pros and cons and connections with different testing levels. We also tried to find approaches that are tailored to test mobile applications. First results show that UML state machine, activity, sequence diagram and of course, a combination of more UML diagrams, are most commonly used for test case generation. Different approaches are used for generation, like graphs, trees, tables, labelled transition systems (LTS), genetics algorithms (GA), finite state machines (FSM) and others. The found approaches have many advantages, but also some disadvantages such as a lack of automatization, problems with complex diagrams and others.

The starting point of a SLR should be a problem from the practice and the results should, somehow, have an impact on improving practice. Objective: To investigate the motivation of software engineering researchers to conduct a SLR and how the results of their reviews are potentially impacting the software engineering practice. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with authors of 120 SLRs published between 2004 and 2010 identified by three tertiary studies previously published. Results: Forty-four authors of SLR participate in the survey. The motivation behind the vast majority of the SLRs was to gather knowledge about a particular field of study. However, only six participants affirmed that their reviews actually had a direct impact in industrial practice. Conclusions: The use of SLR has increased over the years but they were mostly focused on academic problems and had very little impact on industrial practice. Therefore, the full potential benefits of evidence-based software engineering are not being achieved. © 2013 IEEE.","empirical software engineering; evidence based software engineering; survey research; systematic literature reviews","Cross-sectional surveys; Empirical Software Engineering; Evidence based researches; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Industrial practices; Software engineering practices; Survey research; Systematic literature review; Industrial management; Motivation; Research; Surveys; Software engineering","Centre for Informatics (CIn), Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), Cidade Universitária, Recife, Brazil",,,19493770,,,,"English","Int.

Several researchers have also been working on improving the scientific and methodological infrastructure to support SLRs in SE. We argue that there is also an apparent and essential need for evidence-based body of knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of SLRs in SE. Objective: The main objective of this research is to empirically investigate the adoption, value, and use of SLRs in SE research from various perspectives. Method: We used mixed-methods approach (systematically integrating tertiary literature review, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire-based survey) as it is based on a combination of complementary research methods which are expected to compensate each others' limitations. Results: A large majority of the participants are convinced of the value of using a rigourous and systematic methodology for literature reviews in SE research. However, there are concerns about the required time and resources for SLRs. One of the most important motivators for performing SLRs is new findings and inception of innovative ideas for further research. The reported SLRs are more influential compared to the traditional literature reviews in terms of number of citations. One of the main challenges of conducting SLRs is drawing a balance between methodological rigour and required effort. Conclusions: SLR has become a popular research methodology for conducting literature review and evidence aggregation in SE. There is an overall positive perception about this relatively new methodology to SE research. The findings provide interesting insights into different aspects of SLRs. We expect that the findings can provide valuable information to readers about what can be expected from conducting SLRs and the potential impact of such reviews. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Structure of large software systems has been in discussion since early 70s but software architecture started emerging as separate discipline since mid-90s. Objective: Researchers have been publishing empirical studies (i.e. case studies, experiments, experience reports) in SA discipline. Empirical literature has been aggregated in other disciplines of software engineering but no such effort has been made in SA. Objective of this study is to aggregate and synthesize the empirical evidence from literature of software architecture to report the trends, patterns and knowledge gaps. Method: To synthesize the empirical work in SA, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR). This study reports the results of SLR based on 247 included primary studies. Results: Based on the percentage of 247 primary studies we identified that SA Evaluation (28%), non- functional requirements related work (22%) and SA Design (12%) are relatively mature sub areas of SA. Most of the empirical work (59%) in SA uses case study research method. Experiments (20%) and experience reports (14%) are also employed in empirical SA work. Conclusion: SA discipline is maturing as few sub areas of SA are mature and some areas are new and being developed.

Architecture-centric software evolution (ACSE) is considered as an approach to support software adaptation at a controllable level of abstraction in order to survive in the uncertain environment. This requires evolution in system structure and behavior that can be modeled, analyzed and evolved in a formal fashion. Existing research and practices comprise a wide spectrum of evolution-centric approaches in terms of formalisms, methods, processes and frameworks to tackle ACSE as well as empirical studies to consolidate existing research. However, there is no unified framework providing systematic insight into classification and comparison of state-of-the-art in ACSE research. Objective: We present a taxonomic scheme for a classification and comparison of existing ACSE research approaches, leading to a reflection on areas of future research. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR), resulting in 4138 papers searched and 60 peer-reviewed papers considered for data collection. We populated the taxonomic scheme based on a quantitative and qualitative extraction of data items from the included studies. Results: We identified five main classification categories: (i) type of evolution, (ii) type of specification, (iii) type of architectural reasoning, (iv) runtime issues, and (v) tool support. The selected studies are compared based on their claims and supporting evidences through the scheme. Conclusion: The classification scheme provides a critical view of different aspects to be considered when addressing specific ACSE problems. Besides, the consolidation of the ACSE evidences reflects current trends and the needs for future research directions. © 2013 IEEE.","Architecture-Centric Software Evolution; Evidence-Based and Empirical Study; Systematic Literature Review","Architecture-centric; Classification scheme; Empirical studies; Future research directions; Software Evolution; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Uncertain environments; Computer software maintenance; Reengineering; Research","Lero - The Irish Software Engineering Research Centre, School of Computing, Dublin City UniversityIreland",,,15345351,9780769549484,,,"English","Proc.

Three major design issues need to be considered while building software fault-tolerant architectures based on design diversity namely, selection and execution of variants and selection of an adjudication algorithm to determine the correct or adjudicated result from the variants. Each design issue, in turn, can be realized by a set of alternative design solutions, which present different degrees of quality requirements (e.g. memory consumption and reliability). Objective: To investigate whether existing approaches for fault-tolerant composite services support the above mentioned design issues and to provide a detailed classification of the analysed approaches. Method: A systematic literature review of diversity-based approaches for fault-tolerant composite services, which compose our primary studies. Results: We found 17 primary studies providing direct evidence about the research question. Our findings reveal that the primary studies support a wide variety of design decisions. For example, (i) variant services may be chosen at different points during the software lifecycle; (ii) both parallel and sequential execution schemes have been addressed; and (iii) a variety of adjudication mechanisms were found amongst the target papers. Conclusion: We build up a broad picture of what design issues have been addressed by existing diversity-based approaches for fault-tolerant composite services. Finally, practical issues and difficulties are summarized and directions for future work are suggested.

Method: Through the results of a previous review, we identified several contributions to the systematic review process. We define the process using the Business Process Model Notation (BPMN) and relate possible tool contributions to the proposed model. Results: The model and contributions proposed in this paper can be used to guide the development of computational tools to support SLR process and the proper execution of its methodology.

In this paper we present an investigation into the concept of users' involvement during RE activities and explore its relationship with system success. We have conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) using guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. Our SLR identified 87 empirical studies from the period of 1980 to 2012.

OBJECTIVE - The main focus of this paper is to know about the state of art in SPI and to find out the strength of evidence in empirical work reported within SPI literature. METHOD - Methodology of systematic literature review (SLR) is used. A protocol has been developed and executed. Search strings developed and mentioned in the protocol were applied to the databases to extract relevant papers. A set of papers were identified after reading abstracts of papers extracted after application of search string. A quality criterion was applied on this set to finally select the studies for data extraction. Currently, we are at the data extraction phase of SLR. EXPECTED OUTCOME - The anticipated outcome of this systematic review will be state of art in SPI including widely used tools, models, and techniques; reasons to initiate SPI; SPI challenges/Issues widely reported; the SPI areas which are under more consideration; the SPI areas that lack of attention; frequencies of empirical studies in each of the SPI sub-areas. © 2012 IEEE.","Empirical; Software Process Improvement; Systematic Literature Review","Empirical; Quality of product; Return on investments; Software Process Improvement; Software process improvements; Strength of evidence; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Customer satisfaction; Data mining","International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan",,,,9781467322508,,,"English","Int.

SLRs are an important component of the evidence-based practice (EBP) paradigm, which is receiving increasing attention in information systems (IS) but has not yet been widely-adopted. We illustrate the model-driven approach to SLRs via an example focused on the use of BPMN (Business Process Modelling Notation) in organizations. We discuss in detail the process followed in using the model-driven SLR method, and show how it is based on a hermeneutic cycle of reading and interpreting, in order to develop and refine a model which synthesizes the research findings of previous qualitative studies. This study can serve as an exemplar for other researchers wishing to carry out model-driven SLRs. We conclude with our reflections on the method and some suggestions for further research.","BPMN; Evidence-based practice; Qualitative research; Systematic literature review","BPMN; Business process modelling notations; Empirical research; Evidence-based practices; Model driven approach; Model-driven method; Qualitative research; Systematic literature review; Information systems; Occupational therapy; Research","School of Computing, Teesside University, Middlesbrough, TS 1 3BA, United Kingdom",,,,9781627486040,,,"English","Internat.

The aim of the study was to assess the state of the art of the use of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals for palliation therapy of pain from bone metastases. Methods. A systematic literature search was conducted about therapy with 89Sr-chloride and 153Sm-EDTMP between 2001-2011. The primary outcomes were efficacy and toxicity. Descriptive and quantitative data were extracted from each study, calculating event rates and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for pooled analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed. Results. Fifty-seven studies contributed to the systematic review. Forty-six studies used radiopharmaceuticals as a single agent, 15 investigated therapeutic combinations. Most of the studies included patients with prostate cancer. The overall efficacy of bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals as single agents was 70%, whereas it was 74% when used in combination with other therapies. Complete response was reported in 27% of patients. Efficacy resulted to be 70% for prostate cancer and 79% for breast cancer. The overall toxicity of radiopharmaceuticals was 15%: the toxicity was 11% selecting only studies reporting on the use of radiopharmaceuticals as a single agent. No significant difference was found between bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals and other oncological treatments regarding efficacy or toxicity. Reports of objective response outcomes suggest that bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals have some cytotoxic activity, either alone or combination with chemotherapy. Conclusion. This literature analysis emphasizes multiple evidences of high efficacy and low toxicity of bone seeking radiopharmaceuticals; moreover, this therapy may have a therapeutic potential beyond simple palliation of bone pain.","Painful bone metastasis; Palliative care; Radiopharmaceuticals","bisphosphonic acid derivative; docetaxel; doxorubicin; lexidronam samarium sm 153; radiopharmaceutical agent; strontium 89; strontium chloride; bone metastasis; bone pain; breast cancer; cancer palliative therapy; conference paper; confidence interval; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; Embase; external beam radiotherapy; human; Medline; meta analysis; outcome assessment; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk; systematic review; Bone Neoplasms; Comorbidity; Humans; Pain; Palliative Care; Radiation Injuries; Radiopharmaceuticals; Risk Factors; Samarium; Strontium Radioisotopes; Treatment Outcome","D'Angelo, G.; Nuclear Medicine, Catholic University, Largo F.

However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not any systematic discussion about metrics for evaluating Cloud services. By using the method of Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we have collected the de facto metrics adopted in the existing Cloud services evaluation work. The collected metrics were arranged following different Cloud service features to be evaluated, which essentially constructed an evaluation metrics catalogue, as shown in this paper. This metrics catalogue can be used to facilitate the future practice and research in the area of Cloud services evaluation. Moreover, considering metrics selection is a prerequisite of benchmark selection in evaluation implementations, this work also supplements the existing research in benchmarking the commercial Cloud services. © 2012 IEEE.","Catalogue; Cloud computing; Cloud services evaluation; Commercial cloud service; Evaluation metrics","Benchmark selection; Catalogue; Cloud services; Different services; Evaluation metrics; Systematic literature review; Cloud computing; Distributed database systems; Web services; Grid computing","Li, Z.; School of CS, NICTA, ANU, Canberra, Australia; email: Zheng.Li@nicta.com.au",,,15505510,9780769548159,,,"English","Proc.

Although considerable research effort has been made in this area, no agreement has been reached on the influence of dispersion on team coordination and performance. The objective of this paper is to summarize the evidence on the relationship among context dispersion, team coordination and performance in global software projects. We have performed a Systematic literature review (SLR) to collect relevant studies and a thematic analysis to synthesize the extracted data. We found 28 primary studies reporting the impact of five dispersion dimensions on team performance. Previously, only two primary studies considered and distinguished all of these dispersion dimensions in studying dispersed team performance. The dispersion dimensions affect team outcomes indirectly through influencing organic and mechanistic coordination processes. Empirical evidence show that geographical dispersion impacts negatively and temporal dispersion has a mixed effect on team performance. While studies with teams working across different time zones shows a tendency that the team performance is pessimistically perceived, studies that use direct measure on task performance shows a positive association to temporal dispersion. The paper provides implications for future research and practitioners in establishing effective distributed team coordination.

[Aim]: This paper proposes an approach to leverage on empirically evolved ontology to support automating key SLR activities. [Method]: First, we propose an ontology, SLRONT, built on SLR experiences and best practices as a groundwork to capture common terminologies and their relationships during SLR processes; second, we present an extended version of SLRONT, the COSONT and instantiate it with the knowledge and concepts extracted from structured abstracts. Case studies illustrate the details of applying it for supporting SLR steps. [Results]: Results show that through using COSONT, we acquire the same conclusion compared with sheer manual works, but the efforts involved is significantly reduced. [Conclusions]: The approach of using ontology could effectively and efficiently support the conducting of systematic literature review.","ontology; software cost estimation; structured abstract; systematic literature review","Extended versions; Manual work; Software cost estimations; Structured abstract; Systematic literature review; Engineering; Ontology; Software engineering","Sun, Y.; Lab. for Internet Software Technologies, Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100080, China; email: sunyueming@itechs.iscas.ac.cn",,,,9781849195416,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865497582

Objective: The aim of this research is to catalogue GSD SLRs in order to identify the topics covered, the active researchers, the publication vehicles, and to assess the quality of the SLRs identified. Method: We performed a broad automated search to find SLRs dealing with GSD. We differentiate between SLR studies and papers reporting those studies. Data relating to each of the following was extracted and synthesized from each study: authors and their affiliation at the time of publication, the journal or conference in which the paper was published, the quality of each study and the main GSD study topic. Results: Twenty-four GSD SLR studies and 37 papers reporting those studies were identified. Major GSD topics covered include: (1) organizational environment, (2) project execution, and (3) project planning and control. The main research groups are based in Brazil (17), Ireland (8), and Sweden (7). Conclusions: GSD SLR studies are most frequently reported in the International Conference on Global Software Engineering and IEEE Software; the two most popular topics for research are risk factors due to the organizational environment and the development process. The most active researchers are based in Brazil. The quality of the SLR studies has not changed over time.","distributed development; global software development; mapping study; systematic review; tertiary review","Automated searches; Development process; Distributed development; Global software development; Global software engineering; Ireland; Mapping studies; Project execution; Project planning and control; Research groups; Risk factors; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Tertiary study; Publishing; Software design; Research","Verner, J.M.; Keele University, Staffordshire ST5 5BG, United Kingdom",,,,9781849195416,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865513218

The great proliferation of maturity models leads to a need for systematic approaches to build them. Aim: To discover and analyze the existing methods and recommended practices for developing maturity models. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted. Results: 1500 papers were returned as a result of the searches, from which 23 were chosen as candidates, and 7 of these, published between 2005 and 2010, were eventually selected as primary studies. Conclusions: The proposal of methods for maturity models development is an emerging topic in literature. Most published maturity models are based on practices and success factors from projects that showed good results in an organization or industry, but which lack a sound theoretical basis and methodology. The proposed methods highlight as main activities: to establish goals for maturity model development, to design model architecture, to set out capability levels and dimensions, to and pilot testing. However, the creation of an assessment questionnaire and specific activities for maintenance are poorly supported. The SLR results have served to propose a method for developing maturity models that is focused on product quality characteristics.","development method; maturity model; software process improvement","Design models; Development method; Emerging topics; Engineering community; ISO/IEC 15504; Maturity model; Pilot testing; Product quality; Recommended practice; Software Process Improvement; Software Quality; Specific activity; Success factors; Systematic literature review; Theoretical basis; Computer software selection and evaluation; Standards; Software engineering","García-Mireles, G.A.; Departmento de Matemáticas, Universidad de Sonora, Blvd. Encinas y Rosales s/n col.

We assessed the 100 first results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classified publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches.

Method: In this participant-observer case study, we undertook a mapping study of unit testing and regression testing empirical studies, which we compared with a previous expert literature review and with six other mapping studies and systematic literature reviews (SLRs) that addressed overlapping topics. Results: Our mapping study found more clusters than the expert literature review although it benefited from the set of studies identified by the expert review when refining our search process. The set of studies found by our searches were less complete than those found by SLRs addressing more specific topics, although we found some studies missed by those SLRs. Conclusions: Researchers undertaking systematic reviews and mapping studies should make use of related systematic reviews and mapping studies to identify known studies in order to refine search strings and validate search results. For completeness and traceability, mapping studies should keep a record of all multiple reports of a single study. Meta-analyses and other systematic literature reviews undertaking detailed aggregation should report on candidate primary studies that were rejected in the final screening process, as well as candidate studies that were included. This helps ensure the repeatability of aggregation results.","completeness; component; regression testing; software engineering mapping studies; unit testing","completeness; component; Mapping studies; Regression testing; Unit testing; Research; Software engineering; Software testing; Mapping","Kitchenham, B.; School of Computing and Mathematics, Keele University, Keele, Staffordshire, ST5 5BG, United Kingdom; email: b.a.kitchenham@cs.keele.ac.uk",,,,9781849195416,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865525612

A process description is important for coordinating all the software development activities involving both people and technology. Aim: The research question that this study sets out to answer is: What activities do open source software process models contain? The activity groups on which it focuses are Concept Exploration, Software Requirements, Design, Maintenance and Evaluation. Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS). A SMS is a form of systematic literature review that aims to identify and classify available research papers concerning a particular issue. Results: We located a total of 29 primary studies, which we categorized by the open source software project that they examine and by activity types (Concept Exploration, Software Requirements, Design, Maintenance and Evaluation). The activities present in most of the open source software development processes were Execute Tests and Conduct Reviews, which belong to the Evaluation activities group. Maintenance is the only group that has primary studies addressing all the activities that it contains. Conclusions: The primary studies located by the SMS are the starting point for analyzing the open source software development process and proposing a process model for this community. The papers in our paper pool that describe a specific open source software project provide more regarding our research question than the papers that talk about open source software development without referring to a specific open source software project.","open source software development; software engineering; systematic mapping study","Development activity; Evaluation activity; Open Source Software; Open source software development; Open source software projects; Process model; Research papers; Research questions; Software requirements; Systematic literature review; Systematic mapping; Maintenance; Mapping; Paper; Requirements engineering; Research; Software design; Software engineering; Computer software","Acuña, S.T.; Departamento de Ingeniería Informática, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Calle Francisco Tomás y Valiente 11, 28049 Madrid, Spain; email: silvia.acunna@uam.es",,,,9781849195416,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865517266

Several researchers are also working on improving SLR methodology for SE. Objective: The study reported in this paper aims to validate the QGS-based search process for SLR, i.e. whether a more effective (sensitive) and/or productive (precise) search can be achieved by following the QGS-based process. Method: We used a dual-case study, in which each case includes two observations of SE literature search for the same SLR but using and not using the QGS-based approach. The overall sensitivity and precision were calculated for each observation that implemented different search design. Results: The use of QGS-based search process resulted in higher sensitivity and precision in this dual-case study. Conclusions: A systematic search process can help capture more relevant studies as well as save researchers' time spent on literature search activities. Our observations also support that an integrated search strategy is recommended for SLRs in SE to avoid the possible limitations of applying a single (manual or automated) search method.",,"Empirical assessment; Literature search; Search method; Search process; Search strategies; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Time spent; Computer software selection and evaluation; Rating; Research; Software engineering","Zhang, H.; National ICT Australia, University of New South WalesAustralia; email: he.zhang@nicta.com.au",,,,9781849195096,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955171595

Aim: This study investigates the effectiveness of using robots as tools to aid the process of teaching programming and to determine whether such technology can help to overcome the current barriers for learners in this context. Method: The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology has been selected to discover how effective the use of robotics has been in the teaching of introductory programming concepts. Nine electronic databases, the proceedings from six conferences and two journals have been searched for literature relevant to the study. Results: After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria 34 articles have been accepted in the SLR. 74% of included literature report robots to be an effective teaching tool and one that can help novice programmers in their studies. Conclusion: Robots can be a powerful and effective tool when used in an introductory programming course but the potential remains to further investigate methods for their implementation. Thoughts on the use of the SLR methodology from the perspective of a PhD student are also given.","innovative; learning; novices; programming; robotics; robots; SLR; systematic literature review; teaching","innovative; learning; novices; SLR; Systematic literature review; Computer software selection and evaluation; Mathematical programming; Robotics; Robots; Software engineering; Teaching; Robot programming","Major, L.; School of Computing and Mathematics, Keele University, Staffordshire, United Kingdom; email: l.major@epsam.keele.ac.uk",,,,9781849195096,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955242442

Aim: This study aims to identify under what conditions SLRs are likely to be stable, with respect to the primary studies selected, when used in software engineering. The conditions we investigate in this report are when novice researchers undertake searches with a common goal. Method: We undertook a participant-observer multi-case study to investigate the repeatability of systematic literature reviews. The 'cases' in this study were the early stages, involving identification of relevant literature, of two SLRs of unit testing methods. The SLRs were performed independently by two novice researchers. The SLRs were restricted to the ACM and IEEE digital libraries for the years 1986-2005 so their results could be compared with a published expert literature review of unit testing papers. Results: The two SLRs selected very different papers with only six papers out of 32 in common, and both differed substantially from a published secondary study of unit testing papers finding only three of 21 papers. Of the 29 additional papers found by the novice researchers, only 10 were considered relevant. The 10 additional relevant papers would have had an impact on the results of the published study by adding three new categories to the framework and adding papers to three, otherwise empty, cells. Conclusions: In the case of novice researchers, having broadly the same research question will not necessarily guarantee repeatability with respect to primary studies. Systematic reviews must be careful to report their search process fully or they will not be repeatable. Missing papers can have a significant impact on the stability of the results of a secondary study.","Case Study; Repeatability; Systematic Literature Review","Literature reviews; Repeatability; Research questions; Search process; Significant impacts; Systematic Literature Review; Systematic Review; Unit testing; Digital libraries; Publishing; Research; Software engineering; Paper","Kitchenham, B.; School of Computing and Mathematics, Keele University, Staffordshire ST5 5BG, United Kingdom; email: O.P.Brereton@cs.keele.ac.uk",,,,9781849195096,,,"English","IET Semin Dig",Conference Paper,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955242432

Prior research suggests that results summarized in tables are often difficult for readers to understand. One alternative to improve results' comprehensibility is to use graphical representations. The aim of this work is twofold: first, to investigate whether graph representations result is better comprehensibility than tables when presenting SLR results; second, to investigate whether interpretation using graphs impacts on performance, as measured by the time consumed to analyse and understand the data. We selected an SLR published in the literature and used two different formats to represent its results - tables and graphs, in three different combinations: (i) table format only; (ii) graph format only; and (iii) a mixture of tables and graphs. We conducted an experiment that compared the performance and capability of experts in SLR, as well as doctoral and masters students, in analysing and understanding the results of the SLR, as presented in one of the three different forms. We were interested in examining whether there is difference between the performance of participants using tables and graphs. The graphical representation of SLR data led to a reduction in the time taken for its analysis, without any loss in data comprehensibility. For our sample the analysis of graphical data proved to be faster than the analysis of tabular data. However, we found no evidence of a difference in comprehensibility whether using tables, graphical format or a combination. Overall we argue that graphs are a suitable alternative to tables when it comes to representing the results of an SLR. © 2011 IEEE.","Systematic Literature Review; Visual Text Mining","Graph representation; Graphical data; Graphical format; Graphical representations; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Tabular data; Text mining; Software engineering; Graphic methods","Felizardo, K.R.; Department of Computer Science, University of São Paulo - USP, São Carlos, Brazil; email: katiarf@icmc.usp.br",,,,9780769546032,,,"English","Proc. - Braz.

Some possible reasons for the lack of widespread adoption in IS are suggested. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs), a key research method in evidence-based practice, are explained. Recent developments in SLRs are discussed, which enable a richer and more nuanced approach to understanding information systems than found in conventional SLRs. It is proposed that these developments now make SLRs more suitable for synthesising empirical studies in IS. Greater use of SLRs by IS researchers would enable us to develop a cumulative knowledgebase of use to both researchers and practitioners.","Evidence-based; Systematic literature reviews","Empirical studies; Evidence-based; Evidence-based practices; Knowledge base; research methods; Systematic literature review; Occupational therapy; Research; Information systems","Oates, B.J.; Teesside University, School of Computing, Middlesbrough, United Kingdom; email: b.j.oates@tees.ac.uk",,,,,,,"English","Eur.

Such techniques and tools are called proactive forensic approaches, i.e., approaches that can deal with digitally investigating an incident while it occurs. To come up with such an approach, a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was undertaken to identify and map the processes in digital forensics investigation that exist in literature. According to the review, there is only one process that explicitly supports proactive forensics, the multicomponent process [1]. However, this is a very high-level process and cannot be used to introduce automation and to build a proactive forensics system. As a result of our SLR, a derived functional process that can support the implementation of a proactive forensics system is proposed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Anti-forensics; Proactive Forensics Investigation; Reactive Forensics Investigation; Systematic Literature Review and Automation","Anti-forensics; Digital forensic; Investigation process; Multicomponents; Proactive Forensics Investigation; Reactive Forensics Investigation; Systematic literature review; Systematic Literature Review and Automation; Automation; Computer crime; Electronic crime countermeasures; Security of data; Investments","Alharbi, S.; Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of VictoriaCanada; email: salharbi@ece.uvic.ca",,,18650929,9783642231407,,,"English","Commun.

Many of the technical challenges pertaining to the development of SBAs have been addressed, however, there are still outstanding questions relating to the processes required to develop them. Objective: The objective of this study is to systematically identify process models for developing service-based applications (SBAs) and review the processes within them. This will provide a useful starting point for any further research in the area. A secondary objective of the study is to identify process models which facilitate the adaptation of SBAs. Method: In order to achieve this objective a systematic literature review (SLR) of the existing software engineering literature is conducted. Results: During this research 722 studies were identified using a predefined search strategy, this number was narrowed down to 57 studies based on a set of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results are reported both quantitatively in the form of a mapping study, as well as qualitatively in the form of a narrative summary of the key processes identified. Conclusion: There are many process models reported for the development of SBAs varying in detail and maturity, this review has identified and categorised the processes within those process models. The review has also identified and evaluated process models which facilitate the adaptation of SBAs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Objective: The objective of this research paper is to identify and analyse factors that are important in terms of the competitiveness of vendor organisations in attracting outsourcing projects. Method: We performed a systematic literature review (SLR) by applying our customised search strings which were derived from our research questions. We performed all the SLR steps, such as the protocol development, initial selection, final selection, quality assessment, data extraction and data synthesis. Results: We have identified factors such as cost-saving, skilled human resource, appropriate infrastructure, quality of product and services, efficient outsourcing relationships management, and an organisation's track record of successful projects which are generally considered important by the outsourcing clients. Our results indicate that appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, and skilled human resource are common in three continents, namely Asia, North America and Europe. We identified appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, and quality of products and services as being common in three types of organisations (small, medium and large). We have also identified four factors-appropriate infrastructure, cost-saving, quality of products and services, and skilled human resource as being common in the two decades (1990-1999 and 2000-mid 2008). Conclusions: Cost-saving should not be considered as the driving factor in the selection process of software development outsourcing vendors. Vendors should rather address other factors in order to compete in the OSDO business, such as skilled human resource, appropriate infrastructure and quality of products and services. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Although crucial, the process used to select primary studies can be arduous, time consuming, and must often be conducted manually. Objective: We propose a novel approach, known as 'Systematic Literature Review based on Visual Text Mining' or simply SLR-VTM, to support the primary study selection activity using visual text mining (VTM) techniques. Method: We conducted a case study to compare the performance and effectiveness of four doctoral students in selecting primary studies manually and using the SLR-VTM approach. To enable the comparison, we also developed a VTM tool that implemented our approach. We hypothesized that students using SLR-VTM would present improved selection performance and effectiveness. Results: Our results show that incorporating VTM in the SLR study selection activity reduced the time spent in this activity and also increased the number of studies correctly included. Conclusions: Our pilot case study presents promising results suggesting that the use of VTM may indeed be beneficial during the study selection activity when performing an SLR. © 2011 IEEE.","Evidence-based software engineering (EBSE); Study selection activity; Systematic literature review (SLR); Visual text mining (VTM)","Software engineering; Evidence based software engineerings (EBSE); Research questions; Study selection activities; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Text mining; Time spent; Visual text minings (VTM); Data mining","Felizardo, K.R.; Depart. of Computer Science, University of São PauloBrazil; email: katiarf@icmc.usp.br",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,,,,"English","Int.

Several researchers have also been working on improving the scientific and technological support for SLRs in SE. We argue that there is also an essential need for evidence-based body of knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of SLRs in SE. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this research is to empirically investigate the adoption and use of SLRs in SE research from various perspectives. METHOD: We used multi-method approach as it is based on a combination of complementary research methods which are expected to compensate each others' limitations. RESULTS: A large majority of the participants are convinced of the value of using a rigorous and systematic methodology for literature reviews. However, there are concerns about the required time and resources for SLRs. One of the most important motivators for performing SLRs is new findings and inception of innovative ideas for further research. The reported SLRs are more influential compared to the traditional literature reviews in terms of number of citations. One of the main challenges of conducting SLRs is drawing a balance between rigor and required effort. CONCLUSIONS: SLR has become a popular research methodology for conducting literature review and evidence aggregation in SE. There is an overall positive perception about this methodology. The findings provide interesting insights into different aspects of SLRs. We expect that the findings can provide valuable information to readers on what can be expected from conducting SLRs and the potential impact of such reviews. © 2011 IEEE.","Evidence-based software engineering; Methodology adoption; Systematic (literature) reviews","Empirical investigation; Evidence Based Software Engineering; Methodology adoption; Multi-method approach; Research methodologies; Systematic (literature) review; Systematic methodology; Technological supports; Software engineering","Zhang, H.; National ICT Australia, University of New South WalesAustralia; email: he.zhang@nicta.com.au",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,,,,"English","Int.

It is commonly accepted that a good quality experiment is bias free. Bias is considered to be related to internal validity (e.g., how adequately the experiment is planned, executed and analysed). Quality assessment is usually conducted using checklists and quality scales. It has not yet been proven; however, that quality is related to experimental bias. Aim: Identify whether there is a relationship between internal validity and bias in software engineering experiments. Method: We built a quality scale to determine the quality of the studies, which we applied to 28 experiments included in two systematic literature reviews. We proposed an objective indicator of experimental bias, which we applied to the same 28 experiments. Finally, we analysed the correlations between the quality scores and the proposed measure of bias. Results: We failed to find a relationship between the global quality score (resulting from the quality scale) and bias; however, we did identify interesting correlations between bias and some particular aspects of internal validity measured by the instrument. Conclusions: There is an empirically provable relationship between internal validity and bias. It is feasible to apply quality assessment in systematic literature reviews, subject to limits on the internal validity aspects for consideration. © 2011 IEEE.","Checklist; Quality assessment (QA) of experiments; Quality scale; Systematic literature review (SLR)","Quality control; Software engineering; Checklist; Experimental bias; Quality assessment; Quality scale; Quantitative determinations; Software engineering experiments; Systematic literature review; Systematic literature review (SLR); Professional aspects","Dieste, O.; Facultad de Informática, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain; email: odieste@fi.upm.es",,"IEEE Computer Society",19493770,,,,"English","Int.

SLRs are considered to be a new research methodology in Software Engineering, which allow evidence to be gathered with regard to the usefulness or effectiveness of the technology proposed in Software Engineering for the development and maintenance of software products. This is demonstrated by the growing number of publications related to SLRs that have appeared in recent years. While some tools exist that can support some or all of the activities of the SLR processes defined in (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007), these are not free. The objective of this paper is to present the SLR-Tool, which is a free tool and is available on the following website: http://alarcosj.esi.uclm.es/SLRTool/, to be used by researchers from any discipline, and not only Software Engineering. SLR-Tool not only supports the process of performing SLRs proposed in (Kitchenham & Charters, 2007), but also provides additional functionalities such as: refining searches within the documents by applying text mining techniques; defining a classification schema in order to facilitate data synthesis; exporting the results obtained to the format of tables and charts; and exporting the references from the primary studies to the formats used in bibliographic packages such as EndNote, BibTeX or Ris. This tool has, to date, been used by members of the Alarcos Research Group and PhD students, and their perception of it is that it is both highly necessary and useful. Our purpose now is to circulate the use of SLR-Tool throughout the entire research community in order to obtain feedback from other users.","SLR; Systematic Literature Review; Text mining; Tool","Data synthesis; Research communities; Research groups; Research methodologies; SLR; Software products; Systematic Literature Review; Text mining; Text mining techniques; Bibliographic retrieval systems; Computer software maintenance; Research; Software engineering; Text processing; Equipment","Bocco, M.

It was found that, with certain modifications to the process, it was possible to undertake an SLR within a limited time period and to produce valid results. Based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, the student found 28 publications reporting empirical studies of pair programming, of which nine publications were used for data extraction and analysis. Results of the review indicates that whilst pair programming has little effect on the marks obtained for examinations and assignments, it can significantly improve the pass and retention rates and the students' confidence and enjoyment of programming. Following the student study, experienced reviewers re-applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to the 28 publications and carried out data extraction and synthesis using the resulting papers. A comparison of the student's results and those of the experienced reviewers is presented. © 2009 IEEE.",,"Data extraction; Empirical studies; Introductory programming; Pair-programming; Retention rate; Systematic literature review; Teaching tools; Time periods; Computer software; Engineering education; Publishing; Teaching; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Students","Brereton, P.; School of Computing and Mathematics, Keele UniversityUnited Kingdom; email: o.p.brereton@cs.keele.ac.uk",,,,9780769535395,,,"English","Proc. - Conf.

The guidelines suggest that the list can be used to construct a tailored set of questions to evaluate the quality of primary studies. Aim: This paper aims to evaluate whether the list of quality criteria help researchers construct tailored quality checklists. Method: We undertook a participant-observer case study to investigate the list of quality criteria. The “case” in this study was the planning stage of a systematic literature review on unit testing. Results: The checklists in our SLR guidelines do not provide sufficient help with the construction of a quality checklist for a specific SLR either for novices or for experienced researchers. However, the checklists are reasonably complete and lead to the use of a common terminology for quality questions selected for a specific systematic literature review. Conclusions: The guidelines document should be amended to include a much shorter generic checklist. Researchers might find it useful to adopt a team-based process for quality checklist construction and provide suggestions for answering quality checklist questions. © 2009 BCS Learning and Development Ltd.

At the end of the study, we observed some anomalies during the analysis of the extracted data. In our attempts to identify the cause of the anomalies, we found a number of mistakes that had been made during the data extraction process. We discuss each of the mistakes in terms of why they occurred and how they might have been avoided. We suggest a number of ways in which the available guidelines for conducting SLRs should be amended to help avoid such problems occurring in future reviews. © 2008 Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering.

Formally, Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are a part of EBSE. There has been a noticeable take up of SLRs by researchers, but little has been published on whether, and then how, the EBSE methodology has been applied in full. Objectives: To empirically evaluate the use of EBSE by undergraduate students. To consider how insights into the students’ performance with EBSE can be applied to software practitioners’ expected performance with EBSE. To gain insights into the use of Supplementary EBSE Guidelines and associated Assessment Schemes. Method: 37 final-year undergraduate students completed a coursework assessment that required them to use EBSE to evaluate one or more of four Requirements Management Tools (RMTs): Telelogic DOORs®, Borland’s Caliber® Analyst, Compuware Optimal Trace™, and GODA ARTS. Students were provided with a range of EBSE resources, including a set of Supplementary EBSE Guidelines, to assist them with their EBSE evaluation. An Assessment Scheme was development to assess the degree to which students followed the Supplementary Guidelines. A feedback questionnaire, completed by 12 of the 37 students, complemented the Assessment Scheme. Results: 78% of students chose to evaluate a RMT that is currently a market leader. 62% of students subsequently recommended the adoption of their chosen RTM. Some students made a recommendation because the Guidelines indicated they should, rather than making a recommendation because the evidence ‘entailed’ that recommendation. Only 8% of students intentionally made no recommendation, and this seems to be on the basis of the poor quality of evidence available on the chosen RMT(s). All 12 students who completed the feedback questionnaire reported that this was the hardest or nearly the hardest assessment that the student had ever done! 67% of these 12 students reported that they had not given themselves sufficient time to complete the evaluation, and 83% reported that they had to balance their time on this evaluation with other commitments. The12 students found EBSE steps 1 and 4 to be the easiest and EBSE steps 2 and 3 to be the hardest, and they generally reported that they had received sufficient support from the EBSE resources made available to them. Conclusion: This study presents independent, empirical evidence of the full use of EBSE, to complement the growing body of published SLRs. We believe that the findings on students’ use of EBSE are relevant to understanding professional practitioners’ prospective use of EBSE. Both students and professionals would: find EBSE very challenging, in particular the SLRs; be subject to constraints and trade-offs; may not be able to find relevant and rigorous evidence; and may make errors in their critical thinking whilst conducting the evaluation. Our findings should benefit researchers, practitioners and educators. © 2008 Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering.

However, existing research still considers it as a challenge to publish DS contributions in top IS journals, due to the rather strict guidelines that DS publications are expected to follow. Against this backdrop, we intend to emphasize the myriad of configurations and empirically describe the status-quo of DS publications in IS. Based on a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and a conceptually derived analysis frame, we empirically analyze DS papers published in the AIS Senior Scholars' Basket. Thereby, we intend to contribute conceptually and descriptively to the knowledge base of DS, by providing insights based on empirical evidence to aid and guide the discussion towards the advancement of the field. Overall, this shall lay the descriptive foundation for creating prescriptive knowledge on DS in IS by proposing and opening future research avenues. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.
